&#151; </B>Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, Inc. (OTCBB:DJTCQ.OB) (<B><I>&#147;THCR&#148;</I></B> or the <B><I>&#147;Company&#148;</I></B>) announced today that it has reached an agreement with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Luiseno Mission Indians
of California (the <B><I>&#147;Tribe&#148;</I></B>) to transfer the Company&#146;s management agreement (the <B><I>&#147;Management Agreement&#148;</I></B>) to the Tribe. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Company has managed the day-to-day
operations of the Tribe&#146;s casino in Coachella, California under the &#147;Trump 29 Casino&#148; name. The Tribe has agreed to pay the Company a transfer fee of $6.0 million dollars. The transfer agreement is subject to certain court and
regulatory approvals. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Since the commencement of the Management
Agreement in April 2002, the Tribe&#146;s casino has shown significant increases in its operating performance. The Tribe and the Company have mutually agreed to transfer the Management Agreement to the Tribe based on their belief in the Tribe&#146;s
ability to manage the property on its own. Donald J. Trump, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented on the transfer, &#147;Our development and operating expertise has made Trump 29 Casino a great gaming destination in the
Palm Springs area. We are proud of what we have done together with the Tribe, starting with the financing and development of the property and culminating in the record breaking results. It&#146;s now time for the Tribe to assume management
responsibility. The goals set by the National Indian Gaming Commission have certainly been met. I wish Chairman Dean Mike and the entire Tribe continued success with the casino.&#148; </FONT></P>
