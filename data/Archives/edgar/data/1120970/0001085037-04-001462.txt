The proposed closing date for the acquisition had been recently extended, but given recent events involving changes in our management, Bema has advised that it seeks to terminate negotiations pending resolution of any outstanding issues relating to such management changes.  Bema has confirmed that it will revisit negotiations for the acquisition in mid-January and we remain hopeful that the acquisition can be successfully consummated. </P>
