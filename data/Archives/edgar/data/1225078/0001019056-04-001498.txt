Item 3.02.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
               ----------------------------------------

               Registrant completed the sale of 376,208 shares of its common
               stock for cash in the total amount of $4,420,444.00 in a private
               placement to accredited investors on December 23, 2004, in
               compliance with Commission Rule 505 of Regulation D. The
               securities sold are "restricted securities" that may not be sold
               or transferred until expiration of the applicable holding period.

               The Registrant relied upon information provided by each purchaser
               including questionnaires and representations and warranties in a
               stock purchase agreement, to comply with the exemption from
               registration under Rule 505. The Registrant engaged an
               independent firm to analyze the price at which the shares of
               common stock were to be sold and to issue a fairness opinion
               related thereto. There were no underwriting discounts or
               commissions as the Registrant did not engage the services of an
               underwriter or agent and all sales were conducted directly with
               the purchasers by the Registrant.

               The proceeds of the sales referenced above, less the costs
               incurred consisting primarily of professional fees and fees for
               the fairness opinion, will be used to increase the capital ratios
               of the Registrant and its bank subsidiary, Service 1st Bank, in
               accordance with the capital plan discussed below and also for
               general operations purposes.

               As previously disclosed in Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form
               10-QSB for the period ended September 30, 2004, filed with the
               Commission on November 15, 2004, the Registrant committed to
               raise $3 to $5 million in additional Tier 1 capital by December
               31, 2004 to achieve a leverage ratio of 8.5% or higher, in
               accordance with a capital plan adopted in response to the
               Company's asset growth and directives by the California
               Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC, the state and
               federal regulators for Registrant's subsidiary, Service 1st Bank.
