obligations under the Guaranty were secured by an Intellectual Property Security
Agreement (the "Napster Intellectual Property Security Agreement") dated March
25, 2004 between Bank and Napster.

Revolving Facility to December 15, 2006, (ii) add Napster, LLC as a co-Borrower
under the Loan Agreement, (iii) consent to the sale of assets by Roxio to Sonic
Solutions pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement to be entered into
between Roxio and Sonic Solutions (which Asset Purchase Agreement, in the form
provided to Bank as of the date hereof is hereinafter referred to as the
"Purchase Agreement"), (iv) release Bank's security interest in all assets being
sold by Roxio to Sonic Solutions pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and (v)
make such other changes to the Loan Agreement all as more fully set forth
herein,

D. Defined terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the same
meanings as in the Loan Agreement. Hereinafter, (i) all indebtedness owing by
Borrower to Bank shall be referred to as the "Indebtedness", (ii) the
above-described security documents and guaranties, together with all other
documents securing repayment of the Indebtedness shall be referred to
hereinafter as the "Security Documents" and (iii) the Security Documents,
together with all other documents evidencing or securing the Indebtedness shall
be referred to as the "Existing Loan Documents".

Applicable Tax Return; provided, however that Borrower hereby agrees to file the
Applicable Tax Return on or before January 31, 2005. Bank's agreement to waive
the requirement of the timely filing of the Applicable Tax Return pursuant to
this Agreement shall in no way obligate Bank to make any future modifications to

Loan Documents, and shall not limit or impair Bank's right to demand strict
performance of all other terms and covenants as of any date.

4. CONSENT TO SALE OF ASSETS. Subject to the terms and conditions contained

Sonic Solutions pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

obligations to pay any amounts under the Indebtedness. The Borrower acknowledges
and warrants that Bank has acted in good faith and has conducted in a
commercially reasonable manner its relationships with Borrower in connection
with this Agreement and in connection with the Loan Documents, including the
Loan Agreement and the Indebtedness, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any
claims to the contrary.

         (a) Borrower ("Releasing Party") hereby releases, acquits, and
discharges Bank and Bank's employees, agents, representative, consultants,
attorneys, fiduciaries, servants, officers, directors, partners, predecessors,
successors and assigns, subsidiary corporations, parent corporations, and
related corporate divisions (all of the foregoing hereinafter called the
"Released Parties"), from all actions and causes of action, judgments,
executions, suits, debts, claims, demands, liabilities, obligations, damages,
and expenses of any and every character, known or unknown, direct and/or
indirect, at law or in equity, of whatsoever kind or nature, whether heretofore
or hereafter arising, for or because of any matter or things done, omitted or
suffered to be done by any of the Released Parties prior to and including the
date of execution hereof, and in any way directly or indirectly arising out of
or in any way connect to this Agreement and the Existing Loan Documents,
including, but not limited to, claims relating to any settlement negotiation
(all of the foregoing hereinafter called the "Released Matters"). Each Releasing
Party acknowledges that the agreements in this section are intended to be in
full satisfaction of all or any alleged injuries or damages arising in
connection with the Released Matters.

         (b) Releasing Party acknowledges that it has not relied, in executing
the release set forth in this section, upon any representations, warranties, or
conditions by Bank or any other entity except as are specifically set forth in
this Agreement.

         (c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed at any time as an
admission by Bank of any liability to Borrower or any other entity.

         (d) Releasing Party warrants to Bank that it has not purported to
transfer, assign, or otherwise convey any right, title or interest of such
Releasing Party in any Released Matter to any other entity, and that the
foregoing constitutes a full and complete release of all Released Matters.

10. CONTINUING VALIDITY. Borrower (and each guarantor and pledgor signing below)
understands and agrees that in modifying the existing Indebtedness, Bank is
relying upon Borrower's representations, warranties, and agreements, as set
forth in the Existing Loan Documents. Except as expressly modified pursuant to
this Agreement, the terms of the Existing Loan Documents remain unchanged and in
full force and effect. Bank's agreement to modifications to the existing
Indebtedness pursuant to this Agreement in no way shall obligate Bank to make
any future modifications to the Indebtedness. Nothing in this Agreement shall
constitute a satisfaction of the Indebtedness. It is the intention of Bank and
Borrower to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of Existing Loan
Documents, unless the party is expressly released by Bank in writing. No maker,
endorser, or guarantor will be released by virtue of this Agreement. The terms
of this paragraph apply not only to this Agreement, but also to all subsequent
loan modification agreements.

constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the parties relating to
the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
proposals, negotiations, agreements, and understandings relating to the subject
matter. In entering into this Agreement, Borrower acknowledges that it is
relying on no statement, representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of any
kind made by the Bank or any employee or agent of Bank, except for the
agreements of Bank set forth herein. No modification, rescission, waiver,
release, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be made, except
by a written agreement signed by Bank and Borrower.

12. GOVERNING LAW, HEADINGS. This Agreement is one of the Loan Documents defined
in the Loan Agreement and shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California. The headings and captions in this Agreement are
