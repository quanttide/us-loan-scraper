                 (iii)  Final Working Capital Adjustment.

                        (A) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
         than 42 days following the Closing Date, Seller shall, subject to
         Section 2(d)(viii) below, cause the following to be prepared and
         delivered to Buyer: (i) an audited Closing Balance Sheet, together with
         an audit report thereon by a "big four" independent accounting firm
         hired by Seller ("Seller's Accountant"), prepared in accordance with
         GAAP, (ii) a statement based on the audited Closing Balance Sheet which
         sets forth in detail a calculation of the Closing Working Capital of
         the Division as of the Closing Date, and (iii) detailed schedules
         describing any changes between the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
         and the Final Working Capital Adjustment. Buyer shall render all
         reasonable assistance requested by Seller in connection with the
         preparation and audit of the audited Closing Balance Sheet.

                        (B) Following delivery of the audited Closing Balance
         Sheet, the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Working
         Capital shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth
         in Section 2(d)(vi) below.

                        (C) If the difference between the Final Closing Working
         Capital and the Estimated Closing Working Capital is equal to or less
         than $50,000, no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price
         pursuant to this Section 2(d)(iii)(C). If the Final Closing Working
         Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital by more than
         $50,000, the Cash Consideration shall be increased by the amount of
         such excess minus $50,000 and Buyer will pay to Seller an amount equal
         to such excess minus $50,000. If the Estimated Closing Working Capital
         exceeds the Final Closing Working Capital by more than $50,000, the
         Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of such excess minus
         $50,000 and Seller will pay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess
         minus $50,000.

                 (iv)   Reserve Adjustment.

                        (A) Subject to Section 2(d)(iv)(C) below, within twenty
         (20) days after the date that is 9 months following the Closing Date,
         Buyer may prepare and deliver at its sole discretion to Seller a report
         setting forth the Preliminary Reserve Activity (the "Reserve Report").
         Following delivery of the Reserve Report, the Final Reserve Report and
         the Final Reserve Activity shall be determined in accordance with the
         procedures set forth in Section 2(d)(vi) below. For purposes of
         determining the Preliminary Reserve Activity and the Final Reserve
         Activity, the following provisions shall apply: (i) any charge made
         against the End-of-Life component of the Accrued Sales Return Reserve
         shall be based on activity during the nine month period following the
         Closing Date that is specifically attributable to products shipped or
         sold on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) any charges made against the
         Defective RMA or Slow-moving Inventory components of the Accrued Sales
         Return Reserve shall be based on all activity during the five month
         period following the Closing Date, regardless of whether such activity
         can be attributed to products shipped or sold on, before or after the
         Closing Date; (iii) the total number of units charged against the
         Accrued Sales Return Reserve shall in no event exceed, for all
         Inventory Categories, the Final Inventory Level for all Inventory

                                       16
<PAGE>

         Categories minus the number of units of the respective Inventory
         Categories sold through to end-users during the five month period
         following the Closing Date; (vi) no charges associated with any
         end-of-life event occurring after the Closing Date shall be charged to
         the Accrued Sales Return Reserve; and (v) Buyer shall manage returns
         consistent with past practice and ordinary course of business.

                        (B) If the Final Reserve Activity is less than or equal
         to the Reserve Target Amount, no adjustment shall be made to the Cash
         Consideration pursuant to this Section 2(d)(iv)(B). If the Final
         Reserve Activity exceeds the Reserve Target Amount, the Cash
         Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess and
         Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess.

                        (C) Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect not to
         proceed with the preparation of the Reserve Report, in which case
         neither party shall have any further obligations under, and no Purchase
         Price adjustment shall be made pursuant to, this Section 2(d)(iv).

                 (v)    Inventory Adjustment.

                        (A) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall determine
         the estimated number of units, for each Inventory Category, that (i)
         have been shipped and for which invoices have been issued on or prior
         to the Closing Date and (ii) remain in the possession of distributors
         or retailers and have not been sold through to end users (such number
         being the "Preliminary Inventory Level" for such Inventory Category).
         No later than forty-two (42) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
         deliver to Seller a report (the "Preliminary Inventory Report") showing
         thePreliminary Inventory Level for each Inventory Category. Following
         delivery of the Preliminary Inventory Report, the Final Inventory
         Report showing the Final Inventory Level for each Inventory Category
         shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in
         Section 2(d)(vi) below.

                        (B) Promptly after the Resolution Date for the Final
         Inventory Report, the Final Inventory Values shall be determined based
         on the Final Inventory Levels shown on the Final Inventory Report and
         unit prices shown on Section 2(d)(v)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule,
         together with the Category Adjustment Amounts and the Inventory
         Adjustment Amount.

                        (C) If the Inventory Adjustment Amount is equal to the
         Estimated Inventory Adjustment Amount, no adjustment shall be made to
         the Cash Consideration pursuant to this Section 2(d)(v)(C). If the
         Estimated Inventory Adjustment Amount exceeds the Inventory Adjustment
         Amount, the Cash Consideration shall be increased by the amount of such
         excess and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such excess. If
         the Inventory Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Inventory
         Adjustment Amount, the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the
         amount of such excess and Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
         such excess.

                 (vi)   Dispute Resolution; Final Reports.

<PAGE>

                        (A) A "Delivered Report" means the Closing Balance Sheet
         together with the statement of Closing Working Capital delivered
         pursuant to Section 2(d)(iii)(A), the Preliminary Reserve Report
         delivered pursuant to Section 2(d)(iv)(A), or the Preliminary Inventory
         Report delivered pursuant to Section 2(d)(v)(A). For each Delivered
         Report, the "Delivering Party" is the party that delivered such report
         and the "Receiving Party" is the party that received such report
         pursuant to the applicable provisions referred to in the preceding
         sentence.

                        (B) A Delivered Report shall be deemed to be and shall
         be final, binding and conclusive on the parties upon the earlier of
         (the "Resolution Date"): (i) Receiving Party's delivery of a written
         notice to Delivering Party of the Receiving Party's approval of the
         Delivered Report; (ii) the failure of the Receiving Party to notify the
         Delivering Party in writing of a dispute with respect to the Delivered
         Report within 10 days of the delivery of such documents to the
         Receiving Party; (iii) the resolution of all disputes with respect to
         such Delivered Report, pursuant to Section 2(d)(ii)(C), by Buyer's
         Accountant and Seller's Accountant; and (iv) the resolution of all
         disputes with respect to such Delivered Report, pursuant to Section
         2(d)(ii)(C), by the Independent Accounting Firm.

                        (C) The Receiving Party may dispute any amounts
         reflected on the Delivered Report by delivery of a written notice to
         the Delivering Party (the "Dispute Notice"). If the Receiving Party
         delivers a Dispute Notice to the Delivering Party, Buyer's Accountant
         and Seller's Accountant shall attempt to reconcile the parties'
         differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts
         shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. If Buyer's
         Accountant and Seller's Accountant are unable to reach a resolution
         within ten (10) days after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, Buyer's
         Accountant and Seller's Accountant shall submit their respective
         determinations and calculations and the items remaining in dispute for
         resolution to an independent accounting firm of international
         reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the "Independent
         Accounting Firm"). The parties shall cause the Independent Accounting
         Firm to submit a report to Buyer and Seller with a determination
         regarding the remaining disputed items, within twenty (20) days after
         submission of the matter, and such report shall be final, binding and
         conclusive on Buyer and Seller. The fees, costs and expenses of the
         Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by Buyer and Seller in the
         same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed
         items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is
         unsuccessfully disputed by each such party as finally determined by the
         Independent Accounting Firm bears to the total amount of such remaining
         disputed items.

                        (D) The "Final Closing Balance Sheet" shall mean (i) the
         Closing Balance Sheet as originally delivered, if no Dispute Notice is
         delivered with respect thereto or (ii) the Closing Balance Sheet as
         modified to reflect the resolution of any disputed amounts, if a
         Dispute Notice is delivered with respect thereto, and the "Final
         Closing Working Capital" shall be the amount determined from the Final
         Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the definition of Working
         Capital. The "Final Reserve Report" shall mean (i) the Preliminary
         Reserve Report as originally delivered, if no Dispute Notice is
         delivered with respect thereto or (ii) the Preliminary Reserve Report

                                       18
<PAGE>

         as modified to reflect the resolution of any disputed amounts, if a
         Dispute Notice is delivered with respect thereto, and the Final Reserve
         Activity shall be the amount shown as such on the Final Reserve Report.
         The "Final Inventory Report" shall mean (i) the Preliminary Inventory
         Report as originally delivered, if no Dispute Notice is delivered with
         respect thereto or (ii) the Preliminary Inventory Report as modified to
         reflect the resolution of any disputed amounts, if a Dispute Notice is
         delivered with respect thereto, and the Final Inventory Levels shall be
         the quantities shown as such on the Final Inventory Report.

                 (vii)  Payment of Adjustment Amounts and Deferral Amount. Any
amount payable pursuant to Section 2(d)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above shall be
paid by the party owing such amount no later than seven (7) business days after
the date on which such amount is determined pursuant to this Section 2(d). In
addition, Buyer shall pay the Deferral Amount to Seller on the same day that
payment of the amount, if any, to be paid pursuant to Section 2(d)(iv) above is
due; provided that (i) if it is determined that no amount is due under Section
2(d)(iv), then the Deferral Amount shall be paid by Buyer no later than seven
(7) business days after the date on which such determination is made and (ii) if
Buyer makes the election provided for in clause (C) of Section 2(d)(iv), then
the Deferral Amount shall be paid by Buyer on the first business day occurring
at least nine months after the Closing Date. The Deferral Amount shall
constitute an increase of the Cash Consideration.

                 (viii) Balance Sheet and Working Capital Principles. For
purposes of preparing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the audited Closing
Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Balance Sheet, the following principles
shall be applied: (i) each such balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, applied consistently with the accounting methods used in the
preparation of the Pre-Signing Balance Sheet and (ii) all accruals, reserves,
provisions and adjustments customarily made in year-end financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP shall be made in each such balance sheet. The
Estimated and Final Closing Working Capital shall be determined from the
respective Balance Sheets in a manner consistent with the determination of the
Target Working Capital as shown in the second column of the Pre-Signing Balance
Sheet (which excludes from current liabilities both accrued legal and deferred
revenues).

                 (ix)   Determinations by Parties. Each party agrees that all
determinations and judgments made by it in connection with the matters addressed
in this Section 2(d) shall be made in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner.

             (e) The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Morrison &
Foerster LLP, in San Francisco, California, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time
on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than conditions with respect to actions the
respective Parties will take at the Closing itself) or such other date as the
Parties may mutually determine (the "Closing Date").


                                       19

             (f) Deliveries at the Closing. At the Closing, (i) the Seller will
deliver to the Buyer the various certificates, instruments, and documents
referred to in Section 7(a) below; (ii) the Buyer will deliver to the Seller the
various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in Section 7(b)
below; (iii) the Seller will execute, acknowledge (if appropriate), and deliver
to the Buyer (A) assignments (including real property and Intellectual Property
transfer documents) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and (B) such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, and assignment as the Buyer and its
counsel reasonably may request; (iv) the Buyer will execute, acknowledge (if
appropriate), and deliver to the Seller (A) an assumption in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C and (B) such other instruments of assumption as the Seller
and its counsel reasonably may request; and (v) the Buyer will deliver to the
Seller the consideration specified in Section 2(c) above.

             (g) Allocation. [Reserved]

             (h) Non-Assignable Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of
the Acquired Assets are not assignable or transferable (each, a "Non-Assignable
Asset") without the consent of, or waiver by, a third party (each, an
"Assignment Consent"), either as a result of the provisions thereof or
applicable Legal Requirements, and any of such Assignment Consents are not
obtained by Seller on or prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement and the
related instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or transfer
of such Non-Assignable Assets, and Buyer shall not assume Seller's rights or
obligations under such Non-Assignable Asset (and such Non-Assignable Asset shall
not be included in the Purchased Assets). If there are Assignment Consents that
are not obtained by Seller by the Closing Date, without limiting Seller's
obligations under Section 5, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all such Assignment Consents as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date and thereafter assign to Buyer such Non-Assignable Assets.
Following any such assignment, such assets shall be deemed Acquired Assets and
the Liabilities thereunder shall be deemed Buyer Assumed Liabilities for
purposes of this Agreement. After the Closing, Seller shall cooperate with
Buyer, at Seller's expense, in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide
Buyer with all of the benefits of the Non-Assignable Assets as if the
appropriate Assignment Consents had been obtained, including by granting
subleases, establishing arrangements whereby Buyer shall undertake the work
necessary to perform under Seller's Contracts and the enforcement for the
benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller against a third party
thereunder.

3.       Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller represents and
         warrants to the Buyer that the statements contained in this Section 3
         are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and will be
         correct and complete as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as
         though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of this Agreement
         throughout this Section 3), except as set forth in the disclosure
         schedule accompanying this Agreement and initialed by the Parties (the
         "Disclosure Schedule"). The Disclosure Schedule will be arranged in
         paragraphs corresponding to the lettered and numbered paragraphs
         contained in this Section 3.

             (a) Organization of the Seller. The Seller is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation.

             (b) Authorization of Transaction. The Seller has full power and
authority (including full corporate power and authority) to execute and deliver

                                       20
<PAGE>

this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and the consummation by the Seller of
the transactions contemplated hereby do no require any consent or approval of
the Seller's stockholders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
board of directors of the Seller has duly authorized the execution, delivery,
and performance of this Agreement by the Seller. This Agreement constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable in accordance
with its terms and conditions subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to creditors' rights generally or to general principles of equity.

             (c) Noncontravention. Neither the execution and the delivery of
this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the assignments and assumptions referred to in Section 2 above), will
(i) to Seller's Knowledge violate any constitution, statute, regulation, rule,
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge, or other restriction of any
government, governmental agency, or court to which any of the Seller and the
Division Subsidiaries is subject, (ii) violate any provision of the charter or
bylaws of any of the Seller and the Division Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict
with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in the
acceleration of, create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify,
or cancel, or require any notice under, any agreement, Contract, lease, license,
instrument, or other arrangement to which any of the Seller and the Division
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its assets is
subject (or result in the imposition of any Security Interest upon any of its
assets), except in the case of the foregoing clause (iii), for violations,
conflicts, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. Other than in connection with
the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and any applicable foreign antitrust
notifications, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Securities Exchange
Act, WARN and CAL WARN, none of the Seller and the Division Subsidiaries needs
to give any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any authorization,
consent, or approval of any government or governmental agency in order for the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the assignments and assumptions referred to in Section 2 above).

             (d) Sufficiency of Assets. Except as otherwise disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule, the Acquired Assets constitute all of the assets necessary
to conduct the business of the Division as it is conducted as of the date of
this Agreement. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, all
licenses and Contracts disclosed in Section 3(p)(ii)(D) of the Disclosure
Schedule will be available for use by the Buyer on materially identical terms
(i) as of the Closing and (ii) for one year following the Closing. Nothing in
this representation is intended to be construed as a representation concerning
any non-infringement of third party Intellectual Property rights. To Seller's
Knowledge, each Acquired Asset that is a tangible asset (excluding Intellectual
Property) is free from defects (patent and latent) and is suitable for the
purposes for which it presently is used and presently is proposed to be used,
has been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice, and is in good
operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear). None of the
non-Intellectual Property Excluded Assets is necessary to conduct the business
of the Division as it is conducted as of the date of this Agreement.

             (e) Brokers' Fees. The Seller has no Liability or obligation to pay
any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Buyer could become
liable or obligated. None of the Division Subsidiaries has any Liability or

                                       21
<PAGE>

obligation to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

             (f) Title to Assets. The Division and the Division Subsidiaries
have good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, the
properties (other than Intellectual Property) and assets (other than
Intellectual Property) used by them, located on their premises, or shown on the
Most Recent Balance Sheet or acquired after the date thereof, free and clear of
all Security Interests, except for properties and assets disposed of in the
Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet,
except as disclosed on Section 3(f) of the Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on Section 3(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Division has good and marketable title to all of the
Acquired Assets (other than Intellectual Property), free and clear of any
Security Interest or restriction on transfer.

             (g) Subsidiaries. Section 3(g) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth for each Selected Subsidiary (i) its name and jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, (ii) the number of shares of authorized capital
stock of each class of its capital stock, (iii) the number of issued and
outstanding shares of each class of its capital stock, the names of the holders
thereof, and the number of shares held by each such holder, (iv) the number of
shares of its capital stock held in treasury, and (v) its directors and officers
(or, in the case of any foreign Subsidiary, its persons holding office or title
corresponding to directors or officers). Each Selected Subsidiary is a
corporation or limited liability entity duly organized, validly existing, and,
if applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization. Each Selected Subsidiary is duly authorized to
conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
where such qualification is required. Each Selected Subsidiary has full
corporate or organizational power and authority and all licenses, permits, and
authorizations necessary to carry on the businesses in which it is engaged and
to own and use the properties owned and used by it. The Seller has delivered or
made available to the Buyer correct and complete copies of the charter and
bylaws of each Selected Subsidiary (as amended to date). All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Selected Subsidiary have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. One of the
Seller, the Excluded Division Subsidiaries and the Selected Subsidiaries holds
of record and owns beneficially all of the outstanding shares of each Selected
Subsidiary, free and clear of any restrictions on transfer (other than
restrictions under the Securities Act and state and foreign securities laws),
lien for Taxes, Security Interests, options, warrants, purchase rights,
Contracts, commitments, equities, claims, and demands. There are no outstanding
or authorized options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights,
conversion rights, exchange rights, or other contracts or commitments that could
require any of the Seller and its Subsidiaries to sell, transfer, or otherwise
dispose of any capital stock of any of the Selected Subsidiaries or that could
require any Selected Subsidiary to issue, sell, or otherwise cause to become
outstanding any of its own capital stock (other than this Agreement). There are
no outstanding stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation, or
similar rights with respect to any Selected Subsidiary. There are no voting
trusts, proxies, or other agreements or understandings with respect to the
voting of any capital stock of any Selected Subsidiary. The minute books
(containing the records of meetings of the stockholders, the board of directors,
and any committees of the board of directors or the foreign equivalent persons
or entities), the stock certificate books, and the stock record books of each
Selected Subsidiary are correct and complete. None of the Selected Subsidiaries

                                       22
<PAGE>

is in default under or in violation of any provision of its charter or, if
applicable, bylaws. None of the Seller, or the Selected Subsidiaries controls
directly or indirectly or has any direct or indirect equity participation in any

         by the Seller Financial Statements based on such evaluation; and

                        (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves

federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect to
Seller or any of the Division Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended after May

foreign income tax purposes).

             (m) Unpaid Taxes. The unpaid Taxes of Seller and the Division
Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of the Most Recent Fiscal Month End, exceed the

the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Seller

         enforceability, use, or ownership of the item, and Seller is not aware
         of any facts that would indicate a likelihood of same;

                        (D) none of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries

         item outside of the Ordinary Course of Business; and

                        (E) to the Seller's Knowledge, no loss or expiration of
         the item is threatened, pending, or reasonably foreseeable, except for
         Patents expiring at the end of their statutory terms and Contracts

                                       32
<PAGE>

                        (D) to the Knowledge of the Seller, no party to the

contributorily, by inducement or otherwise) misappropriated, or otherwise
violated, and the conduct of the Business as currently conducted and, with
respect to technology currently or historically used in or comprising the

limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of the Seller, no Software Product
interferes with, infringes (directly, contributorily, by inducement or

claim, demand, or notice alleging any such interference, infringement,
misappropriation, or violation (including any claim that any of the Division and
the Division Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual
Property rights of any third party), and the Seller is not aware of any facts
that would indicate a likelihood of the foregoing.

                 (viii) To the Knowledge of the Seller, no third party has
interfered with, infringed upon (directly, contributorily, by inducement or

         created any portion of, or otherwise have any rights in or to, the
         Division Intellectual Property valid and enforceable written

                        (B) to the Knowledge of the Seller, no employee or

                        (C) no funding, facilities or personnel of any
         Governmental Entity were used, directly or indirectly, to develop or

                        (D) the Seller has taken reasonable measures to maintain
         the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights in

         of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or similar
         organization that obligates the Seller to grant or offer to any other
         Person any license or right to any Division Intellectual Property.

                 (x)   No source code for any Software Product or other Software
included in the Division Intellectual Property has been delivered, licensed or
made available by the Division, the Division Subsidiaries or their authorized
licensees or designees to any escrow agent or other Person who is not, as of the
date of this Agreement, an employee or consultant of the Seller. The Seller does

deliver, license or make available the source code for any Software Product or
other Software included in the Division Intellectual Property to any escrow
agent or other Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee
or consultant of the Seller. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or could
reasonably be expected to, result in the delivery, license or disclosure
pursuant to an arrangement or obligation described above of any source code for
any Software included in the Division Intellectual Property to any other Person

                 (xii) To the Knowledge of the Seller, as of the Closing Date,
the Software Products do not contain any "viruses." For the purposes of this
Agreement, "virus" means any computer code designed to disrupt, disable or harm
in any manner the operation of any Software or hardware. To the Knowledge of the
Seller, none of the Software Products contain any worm, bomb, backdoor, clock,
timer or other disabling device, code, design or routine which causes the

incapable of being used, either automatically, with the passage of time or upon
command by any party.

                 (xiii) The Software included in the Division Intellectual
Property does not include any Publicly Available Software, and the Division and
the Division Subsidiaries have not used Publicly Available Software in whole or
in part in the development of any part of the Division Intellectual Property in

Closing Balance Sheet or the Audited Closing Balance Sheet or on the accounting
records of the Seller and the Division as of the Closing Date represent or will
represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made or services
actually performed by Seller in the Ordinary Course of Business. Except to the
extent paid prior to the Closing Date and to Seller's Knowledge, such Accounts
Receivable are or will be as of the Closing Date current and collectible net of
the respective reserves shown on the Pre-Signing Balance Sheet or on the

reserves are adequate and calculated consistent with past practice and in the
case of reserves shown on the Audited Closing Balance Sheet, will not represent
a greater percentage of the Accounts Receivable reflected on the Final Closing
Balance Sheet than the reserve reflected on the Pre-Signing Balance Sheet
representative of the Accounts Receivable reflected thereon and will not

Accounts Receivable in terms of aging). Subject to such reserves, each of such
Accounts Receivable either has been or will be collected in full, without any

coverage; and

or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or permit
termination, modification, or acceleration, under the policy; and (D) no party
to the policy has repudiated any provision thereof. Each of the Division and the
Division Subsidiaries has been covered during the past 10 years by insurance in
scope and amount customary and reasonable for the businesses in which it has

in connection therewith, subject only to the reserve for product warranty claims
set forth on the face of the Most Recent Balance Sheet as adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries. No product manufactured,
sold, leased, or delivered by any of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries

Disclosure Schedule. The product warranty and return experience for the Division
from March 31, 2002 and the interim period through the date hereof is set forth
in Section 3(x) of the Disclosure Schedule. The exclusion of product warranty
reserves on the Financial Statements is in accordance with GAAP and no such
reserves are necessary in light of the circumstances of which Seller is aware.

             (y) Product Liability. To Seller's Knowledge, none of the Division
and the Division Subsidiaries has any Liability (and there is no Basis for any
present or future action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge,
complaint, claim, or demand against any of them giving rise to any Liability)
arising out of any injury to individuals or property as a result of the

            (as hereinafter defined). The Seller shall not, nor shall it permit
            any of its Subsidiaries to, and it shall use its best efforts to
            cause its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates not
            to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly
            encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or knowingly
            take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of
            any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
            lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in this Section 5(h)),
            or (B) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any

            required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to
            the Seller's stockholders under applicable law, the Seller may, in
            response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, and subject to
            compliance with Section 5(h)(iii), (X) furnish information with

            any joint venture agreement entered into by any of Seller, its


                                       47
<PAGE>

            Napster Division, or those of its Subsidiaries that are included in

            combination, sale of a significant amount of assets, sale of shares
            of capital stock, tender or exchange offer of similar transaction
            involving Seller or any of those Subsidiaries that are included in
            Seller's Napster Division or any Excluded Asset (i) which does not
            involve any of the Acquired Assets and (ii) the consummation of
            which will in no way prevent or impair in any material respect the
            Transaction or impair the ability of Buyer to operate the Division
            in a manner consistent with its operation by Seller prior to the
            Closing Date.

                  (ii) Except as set forth in this Section 5(h), neither the
            board of directors of the Seller nor any committee thereof shall (A)
            withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
            adverse to Buyer, the approval or recommendation by such board of
            directors or such committee of the Transaction or this Agreement,
            (B) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
            Acquisition Proposal, or (C) cause the Seller to enter into any
            letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
            other similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") with
            respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            in the event that the board of directors of the Seller determines in
            good faith, after consultation with and based in part on the advice
            of outside counsel, that it is required to do so in order to comply
            with its fiduciary duties to the Seller's stockholders under
            applicable law, the board of directors of the Seller may (subject to
            the following sentences) (X) withdraw or modify its approval or
            recommendation of the Transaction and this Agreement (or decide not
            to recommend it before definitive proxy materials relating to any
            Stockholder Meeting are sent to the Seller's stockholders) only at a
            time that is after the fifth business day following Buyer's receipt
            of written notice advising Buyer that the board of directors of the
            Seller has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material
            terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
            Person making such Superior Proposal or (Y) terminate this Agreement
            by exercising its termination right under Section 9(a)(vii). In
            addition, if the Seller proposes to terminate this Agreement
            pursuant to Section 9(a)(vii), it shall pay to Buyer the Termination
            Fee (as defined in Section 10(k)) at the time prescribed in Section
            10(k). For purpose of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" shall
            mean an Acquisition Proposal made by a third party after the Signing
            Date which, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of
            the Seller, taking into account, to the extent deemed appropriate by
            the board of directors, the various legal, financial and regulatory
            aspects of the proposal and the Person making such proposal, (x) if
            accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and (y) if
            consummated, is reasonably likely to result in a more favorable
            transaction than the Transaction contemplated hereunder considering,
            among other things, and to the extent deemed appropriate in good
            faith by the Board of Directors, the long-term prospects and
            interests of the Seller and its stockholders and other relevant
            constituencies.

                  (iii) In addition to the obligations of the Seller set forth
            in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 5(h), the Seller shall
            promptly, other than following termination of this Agreement
            pursuant to Section 9, advise Buyer orally and in writing of any
            request for information of a nature which would assist a potential
            bidder in preparing an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition
            Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or


                                       48
<PAGE>

            Acquisition Proposal and the identify of the Person making such
            request or Acquisition Proposal. The Seller will keep Buyer fully
            informed on a prompt and current basis of the status and details
            (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
            Acquisition Proposal.

                  (iv) Nothing contained in this Section 5(h) shall prohibit the
            Seller from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
            contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
            Act or from making any disclosure to the Seller's stockholders if,
            in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Seller,
            after consultation with and based in part on the advice of outside
            counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
            fiduciary duties to the Seller's stockholders under applicable law;
            provided, however, neither the Seller, its Board of Directors nor
            any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by Section
            5(h)(ii), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its
            position with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction or

Seller will not and the Seller will not cause or permit any of the Division or
the Division Subsidiaries to hire any additional employees except in the

promptly as practicable following the Signing Date, provide to Seller a list of
those employees to whom it intends to or has offered employment in accordance
with Schedule B. Buyer will offer employment to the Key Employees pursuant to
the terms noted on Schedule B.

             (l) Transition Expenses. Buyer shall be reasonable for and promptly
pay when due all reasonable transition expenses set forth on Exhibit J attached
hereto (the "Transition Expenses").

                                       50

      6. Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties agree as follows with respect to
the period following the Closing.

             (a) General. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
each of the Parties will take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other Party
reasonably may request, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party
(unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Section 8 below). The Seller acknowledges and agrees that from and after the
Closing, the Buyer will be entitled to possession of all documents, books,
records (including Tax records), agreements, and financial data of any sort
relating to the Division and the Division Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
the Seller may, at its own expense, retain copies of such items, other than
source code or related documentation.

             (b) Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party
actively is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with
(i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement (other than between the
Buyer and the Seller) or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving any of
the Division and the Division Subsidiaries, the other Party will cooperate with
the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense,
make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books
and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all
at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the
contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under
Section 8 below).

             (c) Transition. The Seller will not take any action that is
designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor,
customer, supplier, or other business associate of any of the Division and the
Division Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with the
Buyer and the Division Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the
Division and the Division Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. The Seller will
refer all customer inquiries relating to the businesses of the Division and the
Division Subsidiaries to the Buyer from and after the Closing.

             (d) Confidentiality. The Seller will treat and hold as such all of
the Buyer Confidential Information (including any Confidential Information
related to the Acquired Assets), refrain from using any of such Confidential
Information except in connection with this Agreement or permitted under the
Seller License, and deliver promptly to the Buyer or destroy, at the request and
option of the Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of such
Confidential Information which are in its possession, except to the extent
permitted to be used under the Seller License. The Buyer will treat and hold as


                                       51
<PAGE>

such all of the Seller Confidential Information (except any Confidential
Information related to the Acquired Assets), refrain from using any of the
Seller Confidential Information (except any Confidential Information related to
the Acquired Assets) except in connection with this Agreement, and deliver
promptly to the Seller or destroy, at the request and option of the Seller, all
tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the Seller Confidential Information
(except any Confidential Information related to the Acquired Assets), if any,
which are in its possession. In the event that either Party is requested or
required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party, such Party
will notify the other Party promptly of the request or requirement so that such
other Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with
the provisions of this Section 6(d). If, in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Party is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party to any
tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Party may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that such Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of
the other Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Buyer Confidential Information or Seller
Confidential Information, as applicable, required to be disclosed as the other
Party shall designate.

             (e) Covenant Not to Compete. For a period of four years from and
after the Closing Date, the Seller will not engage directly or indirectly in any
business that any of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries conducts as of
the Closing Date in any geographic area in which any of the Division and the
Division Subsidiaries conducts that business as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that no owner of less than 1% of the outstanding stock of any publicly
traded corporation shall be deemed to engage solely by reason thereof in any of
its businesses. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Section 6(e) is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within
which the judgment may be appealed.

             (f) Acquisition Transaction. Seller agrees that it will not engage
in any transaction of the type described in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal (an "Acquisition Transaction") unless: (i) either Seller is the
successor, surviving or transferee entity in such Acquisition Transaction or the
successor, surviving or transferee entity in such Acquisition Transaction
assumes by written instrument reasonably satisfactory to Buyer all of the
obligations of Seller under this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and
(ii) the creditworthiness of the successor, surviving or transferee entity, in
the reasonable good-faith judgment of the Buyer, is sufficient for such entity
to satisfy any financial obligation of Seller remaining under this Agreement.



                                       52
<PAGE>

             (g) Delivery of Financial Statements. Seller shall deliver such
financial statements (collectively, the "Division Financial Statements") as are
reasonably requested by Buyer in order to permit Buyer to prepare and file in a
timely manner (i) a Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to the Transaction

other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which financial
statements shall include, without limitation: (A) three (3) full years of
audited financial statements of the Division; (B) audited financial statements
for the Division for the three (3) and six (6) month periods ending September
30, 2004 (and/or other periods required by the SEC and its rules and
regulations); (C) audited financial information for the Division regarding any
period between the end of a fiscal quarter and ending on the Closing Date; and
(D) the information necessary for the preparation of pro forma financial
statements specified and described in Article 11 of Regulation S-X.

             (h) Share Certificate Legends. The certificates representing the
Buyer Share Consideration will be imprinted with a legend substantially in the
following form:

         The Shares evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under
         the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the
         securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction. The Shares may not
         be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except (1) pursuant
         to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or (2)
         pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
         Act, in each case in accordance with all applicable securities laws of
         the states and other jurisdictions, and in the case of a transaction
         exempt from registration, unless the Company has received an opinion of
         counsel reasonably satisfactory to it that such transaction does not
         require registration under the Securities Act and such other applicable
         laws.

             (i) Corporate Name. On or as soon as practicable after the Closing,
Seller will change its corporate name to a name approved by Buyer that is
dissimilar to Roxio, Inc. From and after the Closing Date, Seller will not use
any name similar to or likely to be confused with the name Roxio, Inc.

             (j) Royalty Sharing Agreement. Buyer agrees that it will pay to
Seller 50% of any Royalties (as defined below) received by Buyer during the
three year period following the Closing Date, subject to the following
additional terms: (i) any amounts payable by Buyer to Seller under this Section
6(j) shall be paid no later than 10 business days after the end of each calendar
quarter or the end of such three year period with respect to the Royalties
received during such quarter or during the portion of such three year period
occurring after the final quarter included therein; (ii) if Buyer is required,
for any reason, to refund or otherwise return any Royalties to a licensee of any
Royalty Patents that were previously the basis for any payment made to Seller
under this Section 6(j), then Buyer shall notify Seller in writing thereof and
specify the reasons for such refund, and Seller shall no later than 10 business
days after such notice pay to Buyer an amount equal to 50% of the amount of the
total Royalties being returned (provided that Buyer may, at its option, setoff
any obligation of Seller to return such amount against any future payment
obligations of Buyer under this Section 6(j)); and (iii) if the total amount of
Royalties received by Buyer during such three year period is less than
$2,000,000 (after giving effect to any refunds or returns with respect to
Royalties received during such period), then no later than 30 days after the end
of such three year period, Buyer shall pay to Seller an additional amount which,
when added to the aggregate amount previously paid to Seller under this Section
6(j) (not including any refunds made by Seller pursuant to clause (ii) above,
equals $1,000,000. For purposes hereof, "Royalties" shall mean any net license
fees or net royalties or any other net reserve actually received by Buyer
pursuant to any licenses of the Royalty Patents granted by Buyer or included in
the Acquired Assets.



                                       53
<PAGE>

             (k) In the event Buyer reasonably determines that it is necessary
to re-audit the Audited Division Financial Statements, whether due to a Seller
Financial Statement Default or otherwise, Buyer and Seller shall share equally
the costs, fees and expenses related to such re-audit. Seller shall pay 50% of
all such costs, fees and expenses promptly upon receipt of an invoice from Buyer
or an Independent Accounting Firm hired by Buyer in connection with such
re-audit.

             (l) Buyer will prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement under the Securities Act relating to the offering and issuance of the
Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration (the "Resale
Registration Statement"). Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to respond
to the comments of the SEC thereon and will make any further filings (including
amendments and supplements) in connection therewith that may be necessary,
proper, or advisable. Seller will provide Buyer with whatever information and
assistance in connection with the Resale Registration Statement that Buyer
reasonably may request. Buyer will take all actions that may be necessary,
proper, or advisable under state securities laws in connection with the offering
and issuance of the Buyer Common Stock. Buyer shall prepare and file the Resale
Registration Statement with the SEC as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than seventy five (75) days following the Closing Date (the "Filing
Deadline"), provided that, in the event that the Filing Deadline falls on a day
that the SEC is not open to receive filings, the Filing Deadline shall be the
next business day that the SEC is open to receive filings. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause, subject to receipt of necessary
information from Seller, the SEC to declare the Resale Registration Statement
effective within one hundred and fifteen (115) days after the Closing Date (the
"Effectiveness Deadline"), provided that, in the event that the Effectiveness
Deadline falls on a day that the SEC is not open to receive filings, the
Effectiveness Deadline shall be the next business day that the SEC is open to
receive filings. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep
such Resale Registration Statement effective during the Effective Period;
provided, however, in the event that:

                  (i) the Resale Registration Statement is not declared
            effective by the Effectiveness Deadline; or

                  (ii) the Resale Registration Statement has been declared
            effective but such Resale Registration Statement ceases to be
            effective at any time during the Effective Period (each such event,
            a "Registration Default"), Buyer hereby agrees to pay liquidated
            damages and not as a penalty ("Liquidated Damages") with respect to
            the Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration
            from and including the day following the Registration Default to but
            excluding the day on which the Registration Default has been cured
            in an amount per day for each day a Registration Default existed
            equal to $3,300.00; and for any such day, such payment of Liquidated
            Damages shall be made no later than the first business day of the
            calendar month succeeding the month in which such day occurs;
            provided, however, that no Liquidated Damages shall be due to Seller
            for any day on which a Registration Default has occurred and is
            continuing if the occurrence or continuation of such Registration
            Default on such day is the result of a Seller Financial Statement
            Default.

With respect to the registration of the Buyer Common Stock constituting the
Buyer Share Consideration, the Buyer agrees to:

                  (iii) cause the Resale Registration Statement and any related
            prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto to comply in all
            material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
            Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

                  (iv) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
            withdrawal as soon as practicable of any order suspending the
            effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement.

                  (v) comply with all rules and regulations of the SEC to the
            extent and so long as they are applicable to any registration of the
            Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration
            pursuant to the Securities Act and will make generally available to
            its security holders (or otherwise provide in accordance with
            Section 11(a) of the Securities Act) an earnings statement
            satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act no
            later than fifty (50) days after the end of a twelve (12)-month
            period (or one hundred and five (105) days, if such period is a
            fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Buyer's first
            fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Resale
            Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall cover such
            twelve (12)-month period.

                  (vi) use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
            Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration to be
            sold pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement to be listed on
            the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other securities exchanges or markets
            on which shares of Buyer Common Stock are then listed.

         In the event of a registration of any offering of any Buyer Common
Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration under the Securities Act
pursuant to this Section 6(l), the Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its permitted assign(s) against any Adverse Consequences, to which the
Seller or assignee may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such Adverse Consequences arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Resale Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise
out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Seller or assignee for any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Seller or assignee in connection
therewith; provided, that, the Buyer will not be liable in any such case if and
to the extent that any such Adverse Consequence arises out of or is based upon
an untrue statement or omission so made in conformity with information furnished
in writing by the Seller or assignee specifically for use in such Resale
Registration Statement; provided, further, that, the liability of the Buyer or
assignee hereunder, shall not in any event exceed the proceeds from the sale of
the Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration covered by
such Resale Registration Statement.



                                       55

         In the event of a registration of any offering of any Buyer Common
Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration under the Securities Act
pursuant to this Section 6(l), the Seller will indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls
the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section
20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents and employees of
such controlling Persons, against any Adverse Consequences, to which the Buyer
or such Person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, if and
to the extent such Adverse Consequences arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or omission made in conformity with information furnished in
writing by the Seller or its assignee(s) specifically for use in such Resale
Registration Statement, and will reimburse the Buyer or such Person for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Buyer or such Person in
connection therewith, provided, however, the liability of the Seller or assignee
hereunder, shall not in any event exceed the proceeds from the sale of the Buyer
Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share Consideration covered by such Resale
Registration Statement.

         For so long as the Buyer is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act and any of the Buyer Common Stock
constituting the Buyer Share Consideration is not freely tradable under Rule
144(k) of the Securities Act, the Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts
to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted
by the SEC thereunder, or, if the Buyer ceases to be so required to file such
reports, it will, upon the request of the Seller, (i) make publicly available
such information as is necessary to permit sales of the Buyer Common Stock
constituting the Buyer Share Consideration pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and (ii) take such further action that is reasonable in the
circumstances, in each case, to the extent required from time to time to enable
the Seller to sell the Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Share
Consideration without registration under the Securities Act within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The
Seller agrees that it will not effect any disposition of the Buyer Common Stock
constituting the Buyer Share Consideration except as contemplated in the Resale
Registration Statement or as otherwise permitted by applicable law and by this
Agreement.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer's
obligations pursuant to this Section 6(l) shall survive until satisfied pursuant
to its terms. The procedure for any indemnification claims under this Section
6(l) shall be as set forth in Section 8(d), mutatis mutandis.

         breaches of all the representations and warranties, if any (excluding,
         for this purpose, any qualifications as to materiality therein or in
         the Company Disclosure Schedule), in the aggregate, do not have a
         Material Adverse Effect;

                  (v) the Seller shall have delivered to the Buyer a certificate

         any portion of the Purchase Price thereunder (the "FIRPTA Affidavit");

                  (ix) there has been no Material Adverse Effect; and

             (a) Survival. All representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations in this Agreement or in any agreement, instrument or other document
delivered in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof, the consummation of the transactions contemplated and any investigation
or audit conducted by any Party hereto. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
neither party may make or assert any claim under any representation or warranty
of the other Party contained herein later than eighteen months after the Closing
Date, except that (i) the representations and warranties contained in Sections
3(b), 3(f), 4(b) and 4(e) shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations
and warranties in Sections 3(l) and 3(m) shall not survive after the Closing
Date, and (iii) the representations and warranties in Section 3(aa) shall
survive until 60 days after the statute of limitations with respect to the
matters addresses therein has expired (including all waivers or extensions
thereof); and provided that any claims made or asserted by a Party within the
applicable time period prescribed above shall survive such expiration until such
claim is finally resolved and all obligations with respect thereto are fully
satisfied. All statements contained in any officer's certificate delivered by or
on behalf of any Party hereto to this Agreement shall constitute and have the
same force and effect as the representations and warranties of such party set
forth herein.

             (b) Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Buyer.

                  (i) (A) The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
         the Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any and all Adverse
         Consequences the Buyer or any such Affiliate may suffer through and
         after the date of the claim for indemnification (including any Adverse
         Consequences the Buyer or such Affiliate may suffer after the end of
         any applicable survival period) resulting from, arising out of, or
         caused by (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Seller
         contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement
         (other than the representations in Sections 3(l) and 3(m) hereof for
         which the Seller shall not have any indemnification obligation), (b)
         any breach of a covenant of the Seller contained in this Agreement or
         in any other Transaction Agreement (other than breaches of Section
         6(k)), (c) any Liability of the Seller with respect to the Division or
         of the Division Subsidiaries of which Seller had Knowledge and which
         was not disclosed to the Buyer prior to the Closing (regardless of
         whether the Liability is an Assumed Liability), or (d) the occurrence
         or the continuation of any Seller Financial Statement Default;
         provided, however, that (x) the Seller shall not have any obligation to
         indemnify the Buyer and/or its Affiliates under this Section 8(b)(i)(A)
         from and against any Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out
         of, relating to, or caused by any breach (or alleged breach) or
         Liability of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above
         until the Buyer and/or its Affiliates have suffered Adverse
         Consequences by reason of all such breaches (or alleged breaches) or
         Liabilities in excess of a $1 million aggregate deductible (after which
         point the Seller will be obligated only to indemnify the Buyer from and
         against further such Adverse Consequences), it being acknowledged that
         the Seller's obligation under this Section 8(b)(i)(A) with respect to
         any matters of the type referred to in clause (d) above shall not be
         subject to the limitation set forth in this clause (x), (y) in no event
         shall the total obligation of the Seller to indemnify the Buyer and its
         Affiliates under this Section 8(b)(i)(A) from and against Adverse
         Consequences exceed $15 million in the aggregate with respect to
         Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or
         caused by breaches (or alleged breaches), Liabilities or matters of the
         type referred to in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above (other than
         breaches of Section 6(e)) that occur prior to the first anniversary of
         the Closing Date, and (z) in no event shall the total obligation of the
         Seller to indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates under this Section
         8(b)(i)(A) from and against Adverse Consequences exceed the Second Cap
         Amount with respect to Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out
         of, relating to, or caused by (1) breaches (or alleged breaches) or
         Liabilities of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above
         (other than breaches of Section 6(e)) that occur after the first
         anniversary of the Closing Date and no later than 18 months after the
         Closing Date and/or (2) matters of the type referred to in clause (d)
         above that occur after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and no
         later than the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

<PAGE>

                 (B) Without limiting the Seller's obligations under Section
         8(b)(i)(A) above (the "Base Indemnification"), if, as a result of
         clause (x), (y) or (z) of the proviso in the Base Indemnification, the
         Seller is not obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
         Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any Adverse Consequences the
         Buyer or any such Affiliate may suffer through and after the date of
         the claim for indemnification (including any Adverse Consequences the
         Buyer or such Affiliate may suffer after the end of any applicable
         survival period) resulting from, arising out of, or caused by a breach
         of the representations contained in Section 3(a) or Section 3(b), then
         the Seller agrees that it will pursuant to this Section 8(b)(i)(B) (the
         "Supplemental Indemnification") indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
         Buyer and its Affiliates from and against such Adverse Consequences,
         provided that (x) in no event shall the total obligation of the Seller
         to indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates under this Section 8(b)(i)(B)
         from and against such Adverse Consequences exceed $15 million and (y)
         in no event shall the Supplemental Indemnification apply to any such
         Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out of, or caused by a
         breach of the representations contained in Section 3(a) and Section
         3(b) that occurs after the third anniversary of the Closing Date.

                  (ii) The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
         Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any and all Adverse
         Consequences the Buyer or any such Affiliate may suffer through and
         after the date of the claim for indemnification to the extent resulting
         from, arising out of, relating to, or caused by:

                 (A) any Seller Retained Liability;



                                       60
<PAGE>

                 (B) any Liability of Seller or any of the Division Subsidiaries
         for unpaid Tax Liabilities with respect to any Tax year or portion
         thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (or for any Tax year
         beginning before and ending after the closing Date to the extent
         allocable to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on
         the Closing Date), to the extent such Tax Liabilities are not reflected
         on the face of the Final Closing Balance Sheet (rather than in any
         notes thereto and excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established
         to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) and to the
         extent that such Tax Liabilities or the payment thereof does not create
         a realized reduction in Tax Liabilities to the Buyer or Selected
         Subsidiaries;

                 (C) any Liability of any of the Division Subsidiaries for the
         unpaid Taxes of any Person (including the Seller and its Subsidiaries)
         under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local,
         or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or
         otherwise;

                 (D) any breach of Seller's obligations under Section 6(k); or

                 (E) any stamp duty arising in connection with the transfer of
         Roxio UK Ltd. to the Buyer.

                  (iii) In the event that any Liability described in Section
         8(b)(ii) is also described in Section 8(b)(i), the obligation of Seller
         shall be determined under Section 8(b)(ii) and shall not be subject to
         the limitations of Section 8(b)(i).

             (c) Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller. The Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller from and against any and
all Adverse Consequences the Seller may suffer through and after the date of the
claim for indemnification resulting from, arising out of, related to, or caused
by (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in this
Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement, (b) any breach of a covenant of
the Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement, (c)
any Buyer Assumed Liability (except to the extent that Seller is obligated
pursuant to clause (c) of Section 8(b)(i), which include the limitations set
forth in clauses (x), (y) and (z) thereof, to indemnify Buyer for such
liability).

             (d) Matters Involving Third Parties. (i) If any third party shall
notify any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third
Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the
other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Section 8, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; which notice shall provide reasonable detail and specificity as to the
claim or proceeding and the amount of damages sought in such claim or
proceeding; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.

                  (ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified
         Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
         defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof
         with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. Should the
         Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party


                                       61
<PAGE>

         Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
         Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
         Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
         assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
         participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
         expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party,
         it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
         defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and
         expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
         during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
         (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have
         failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If
         the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
         Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or
         prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
         (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the
         Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably
         relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a
         mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
         explanation of any material provided hereunder.

                  (iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii) above, (x) the Indemnified
         Party may, by prior written notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume
         the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnified Party shall
         have been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal defenses
         available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or in
         addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the
         reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party and its counsel, counsel
         for the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests
         of the Indemnified Party because such interests would be in conflict
         with those of the Indemnifying Party, or (y) if a Third Party claim
         seeks injunctive or equitable relief in addition to monetary damages
         for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
         the Indemnified Party may, by prior written notice to the Indemnifying
         Party, assume the right to defend the injunctive or equitable relief
         claim (but not the monetary damages claims); provided, however, if the
         Indemnified Party assumes defense of such injunctive or equitable
         relief claim, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the provisions of this
         Section 8, shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of
         counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in defending, compromising or
         settling such claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party's liability
         with respect to any settlement or compromise shall be subject to
         Section 8(d)(iv) below. In the event of a Third Party injunctive or
         equitable relief claim that would fall under both subsections (x) and
         (y) of this Section 8(d)(iii), subsection (y) shall control.

                  (iii) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the
         defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit
         any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
         Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written
         consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
         Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
         Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
         discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may
         recommend and that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay
         the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party
         Claim, and which releases the Indemnified Party completely in
         connection with such Third Party Claim; provided that the Indemnifying
         Party shall not agree, without the Indemnified Party's consent, to the
         entry of any Judgment or settlement, compromise or decree that provides
         for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified
         Party.

             (e) Determination of Adverse Consequences. The Parties shall take
into account the time cost of money (using the Applicable Rate as the discount
rate) in determining Adverse Consequences for purposes of this Section 8.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Adverse Consequences in each
case shall be net of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity and
contribution, after using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate, actually
recovered by any Indemnified Parties. Indemnified Parties shall have a duty to
mitigate Adverse Consequences with respect to any claim made under this Section
8. All indemnification payments under this Section 8 shall be deemed adjustments
to the Purchase Price. In addition, the Adverse Consequences for which
indemnification is being provided pursuant to this Section 8 shall be determined
based on the principles of causality, sufficiency of proof and reasonable
foreseeability that are customarily applied by a court in the United States in
determining the damages recoverable by a party in a breach of contract action.

             (f) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof to the contrary, the Parties agree that, absent fraud, from and after the
Closing, subject only to Section 10(o), the indemnification remedies set forth
in this Section 8 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer,
the Seller and their Affiliates for any claims pursuant to, or arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

      9. Termination.

             (a) Termination of Agreement. Certain of the Parties may terminate
this Agreement as provided below:

                  (i) the Buyer and the Seller may terminate this Agreement by
         mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

                  (ii) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written
         notice to the Seller at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event
         the Seller has breached any material representation, warranty, or
         covenant contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the Buyer
         has notified the Seller of the breach, and the breach has continued
         without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice of breach and the
         breach has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect or (B) if the Closing
         shall not have occurred on or before January 15, 2005, by reason of the
         failure of any condition precedent under Section 7(a) hereof (unless
         the failure results primarily from the Buyer itself breaching any
         representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement);

                  (iii) by either the Buyer or the Seller, if any decree,
         permanent injunction, judgment, order or other action by any court of
         competent jurisdiction or any Governmental Entity preventing or
         prohibiting consummation of the Transaction (an "Order") shall have
         become final and nonappealable;



                                       63
<PAGE>

                  (iv) by either the Buyer or the Seller, if the transaction
         shall fail to receive the requisite vote the Seller stockholders at the
         Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment thereof;

                  (v) (a) by the Buyer, if the board of directors of the Seller
         or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn or modified in any manner
         adverse to the Buyer its approval or recommendation of the Transaction
         or this Agreement (b) or approved or recommended or announced an
         intention to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal;

                  (vi) the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written
         notice to the Buyer at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event
         the Buyer has breached any material representation, warranty, or
         covenant contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the
         Seller has notified the Buyer of the breach, and the breach has
         continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice of
         breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
         January 15, 2005, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent
         under Section 7(b) hereof (unless the failure results primarily from
         the Seller itself breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant
         contained in this Agreement); and

                  (vii) by the Seller, upon five (5) business days' notice, in
         accordance with Section 5(h)(ii), provided it has complied with the
         provisions thereof and that it complies with the provisions of Section
         10(k) related thereto.

             (b) Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9(a) above, all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any Liability of any Party to the other Party
(except for any Liability of any Party then in breach) provided, however, that
the Buyer will treat and hold as such all of the Seller Confidential Information
and Buyer Confidential Information, refrain from using any of the Buyer
Confidential Information, and destroy all tangible embodiments (and all copies)
of the Seller Confidential Information and Buyer Confidential Information which
are in its possession.

      10. Miscellaneous.

             (a) Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue
any press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of the
other Party; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other Party
prior to making the disclosure).

             (b) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

             (c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or


                                       64
<PAGE>

between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they have related in any way
to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety
the Asset Purchase Agreement between Buyer and Seller, dated as of August 9,
2004 (the "Original Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exhibits and
Schedules delivered in connection with the Original Agreement are deemed to
apply as if delivered in connection with this Agreement, except that Exhibit A
and Exhibit E attached hereto shall replace and supersede Exhibit A and Exhibit
E attached to the Original Agreement.

             (d) Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Party, which approval may be withheld in such party's sole
discretion; provided however, (i) that the Buyer may (x) assign any or all of
its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and (y)
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in
any or all of which cases the Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder) and (ii) that the Seller may
assign this Agreement and any or all of its rights and interests, liabilities
and obligations hereunder in connection with a Change of Control of Seller
(subject to compliance with Section 6(f)).

             (e) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

             (f) Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

             (g) Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder will be in writing. Any notice, request, demand, claim,
or other communication hereunder shall be deemed duly given three (3) business
days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,
postage prepaid, or one business day after it is sent by overnight courier,
postage prepaid, in each case and addressed to the intended recipient as set
forth below:

Any Party may send any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication
hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth above using any
other means (including personal delivery, facsimile, or electronic mail), but no
such notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication shall be deemed to
have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the intended
recipient. Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands,
claims, and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the
other Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

             (h) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
California.

             (i) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Buyer and the Seller. The Seller may consent to any such amendment at any time
prior to the Closing with the prior authorization of its board of directors;
provided, however, that any amendment effected after the Seller stockholders
have approved this Agreement will be subject to the restrictions contained in
the Delaware General Corporation Law. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

             (j) Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

             (k) Expenses. Each of the Buyer, the Seller, and the Division
Subsidiaries will bear his or its own costs and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that (i) the Seller will also bear the
costs and expenses of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries (including all
of their legal fees and expenses) in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in the event that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated and will bear the expenses of any accounting
fees associated with the preparation, inclusion or review of financial
statements included in the Resale Registration Statement or any filing of such
Seller or Division financial statements in any filing with the SEC or any
foreign jurisdiction as well as the cost of any review by counsel for the Seller
of the Resale Registration Statement and (ii) the Seller will also bear the
costs and expenses (including all legal fees and expenses) in connection with
the HSR filing and the registration of the Buyer Common Stock constituting the
Buyer Share Consideration, each as contemplated under Section 5 hereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall pay all Transfer Taxes
when due, whether or not imposed on Buyer or Seller as a matter of law;
provided, however that the Buyer cooperates to a commercially reasonable extent
with Seller to minimize the Transfer Taxes that Seller is required to pay,
including, without limitation, accepting delivery of Seller's intangible assets
that constitute part of the Acquired Assets through electronic delivery or in
another manner reasonably calculated and legally permitted to minimize the
incurrence of Transfer Taxes. Except for Tax Returns required by law to be
prepared by Buyer, Seller shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and
Seller will, and will cause their affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.



                                       66
<PAGE>

         If (i) the Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
9(a)(vii) following receipt by the Seller of a proposal for an Acquisition
Proposal (including a Superior Proposal) or (ii) Buyer terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 9(iv) or 9(v)(a), then, within five business days of such
termination in the case of clause (i) or clause (ii) the Seller shall pay by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the Buyer an amount equal to 3%
of the Purchase Price (the "Termination Fee"), provided, that in the case of
clause (ii), Seller will pay an additional amount to Buyer equal to the amount
of Buyer's reasonable costs and expenses associated with the preparation of this
Agreement and reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transaction.

             (l) Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The Parties intend
that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant. The term
"made available,"(i) prior to the Closing Date shall mean items, documents,
materials and other data physically provided at the following locations;
O'Melveny & Myers' San Francisco and Menlo Park Offices and Roxio's headquarters
and (ii) on the Closing Date shall mean physically delivered to the Buyer or its
representatives at a location and pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by
Buyer.

             (m) Disclosure Schedule. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with sufficient
particularity and description of the relevant facts so as to make the disclosure
of such exception reasonably clear. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item
shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or
warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty has to do with the
existence of the document or other item itself or unless such exception is
reasonably clear from its listing or inclusion on the Disclosure Schedule).
Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule constitutes an admission of any liability or
obligation of Seller of any of its Subsidiaries to any third party, nor an
admission against Seller's or any of its Subsidiaries' interest to any third
party. The Disclosure Schedule contains information, descriptions and
disclosures regarding Seller and its Subsidiaries only, all of which constitutes
confidential information of Seller and its Subsidiaries. The Disclosure Schedule


                                       67
<PAGE>

is qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of this
Agreement, and is not intended to expand the scope and effect of any
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller provided in this Agreement.
The Disclosure Schedule may include items or information that Seller is not
required to disclose under this Agreement; disclosure of such information shall
not affect (directly or indirectly) the interpretation of this Agreement or the
scope of the disclosure obligation under this Agreement. The inclusion of any
information in the Disclosure Schedule does not constitute an admission that
such information is required to be disclosed, that such information is material
or that any other undisclosed matter having a greater value or other
significance is material or is otherwise required to be disclosed.

             (n) Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and
made a part hereof.

             (o) Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that
the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matter (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 10(p)
below), in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or
in equity.

             (p) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in San Francisco, California
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each
of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Nothing
in this Section 10(p), however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law or in equity. Each Party
agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law or in equity.

             (q) Tax Matters.

                  (i) Any agreement between the Seller and any of the Division
         Subsidiaries regarding allocation or payment of Taxes or amounts in
         lieu of Taxes shall be deemed terminated at and as of the Closing.



                                       68
<PAGE>

                  (ii) The Seller will be responsible for the preparation and
         filing of all Tax Returns for the Seller for all periods as to which
         Tax Returns are due after the Closing Date (including the consolidated,
         unitary, and combined Tax Returns for the Seller which include the
         operations of the Division and the Division Subsidiaries for any period
         ending on or before the Closing Date). The Seller will make all
         payments required with respect to any such Tax Return.

                  (iii) The Buyer will be responsible for the preparation and
         filing of all Tax Returns for the Division (except with respect to
         Division Subsidiaries which are not Selected Subsidiaries) and the
         Selected Subsidiaries for all periods as to which Tax Returns are due
         after the Closing Date (other than for Taxes with respect to periods
         for which the consolidated, unitary, and combined Tax Returns of the
         Seller will include the operations of the Division and the Division
         Subsidiaries). Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of such Tax
         Returns for its reasonable review prior to filing. The Buyer will make
         all payments required with respect to any such Tax Return; provided,
         however, that the Seller will reimburse the Buyer concurrently
         therewith to the extent any payment the Buyer is making relates to the
         operations of any of the Division and the Selected Subsidiaries for any
         period ending on or before the Closing Date, to the extent such Taxes
         are not reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
         reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
         between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Most Recent
         Financial Statements (rather than in any notes thereto) as such reserve
         is adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
         accordance with the past custom and practice of Seller and the Division
         Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.

                  (iv) Following the Closing, Buyer, in its sole discretion, may
         make elections under Code Section 338(g) with respect to one or more
         Selected Subsidiaries. Seller agrees to cooperate, and to cause any
         Division Subsidiary which is not a Selected Subsidiary to cooperate,
         with Buyer, as requested, to facilitate such elections.

                  (v) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes
         that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period
         that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of
         such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
         Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based
         upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of
         such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
         numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on
         the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the entire Tax period,
         and (B) in the case of any tax based upon or related to income or
         receipts shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
         the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

             (r) Employee Benefits Matters.

                  (i) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, or
         shall cause the Division and the Division Subsidiaries to provide the
         Acquired Employees with compensation and benefit packages that
         substantially similar in the aggregate to those which the Buyer
         provides to its own similarly-situated employees; provided, however
         that nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part
         of the Buyer to continue the employment of any Acquired Employee for
         any period of time.



                                       69
<PAGE>

                  (ii) From and after the Closing, the Acquired Employees shall
         generally be eligible to participate in the Employee Benefit Plans
         maintained by the Buyer for the benefit of its employees and their
         beneficiaries (the "Buyer Benefit Plans"). For purposes of all Buyer
         Benefit Plans under which an Acquired Employee's eligibility for
         benefits depends, in whole or in part, on length of service, Buyer
         shall make commercially reasonable efforts to credit all Acquired
         Employees with their prior service with Seller (including service with
         a predecessor employer to the extent such service was credited);
         provided that such service credit does not result in duplication of
         benefits. Subject to the consent of any applicable insurance carrier
         and the terms of the Buyer Benefit Plans, Buyer will use commercially
         reasonable efforts: (1) to credit the Acquired Employees with any
         deductible or co-payment amounts paid under an analogous Seller Benefit
         Plan (excluding office visit co-pays) in respect of the plan year in
         which the Closing Date occurs; and (2) to waive, to the extent waived
         under the applicable Seller Benefit Plans any pre-existing condition or
         other restriction under the Buyer Benefit Plans or any waiting period
         limitation that would otherwise apply to Acquired Employees under the
         Buyer Benefit Plans. It is understood that the Buyer reserves the right
         and sole discretion to change, modify, discontinue or terminate any or
         all of the Buyer Benefit Plans at any time following the Closing Date.
