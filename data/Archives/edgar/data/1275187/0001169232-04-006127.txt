         Angiodynamics reports Fiscal second quarter eps up 50% to $0.09

                 Conference call to begin today at 4:30 p.m. ET

QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (December 20, 2004)--AngioDynamics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANGO) today
announced financial results for the 13 and 26 weeks ended November 27, 2004.

Highlights of the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 (September through
November) and recent weeks include:

o     Net sales up 22% to $14.4 million

o     Gross margins up 497 basis points to 56%

o     Net earnings up 71% to $1.0 million

o     Diluted earnings per share up 50% to $0.09

o     Favorable CMS reimbursement codes for VenaCure(TM) procedure

o     Anthem agrees to cover VenaCure

o     AngioDynamics stock distributed to E-Z-EM shareholders in the completion
      of the spin-off of the Company

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $14.4 million, up 22%,
compared with net sales of $11.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal year
2004. This increase was primarily due to strong growth from the Company's newest
products, along with continued market share gains across the entire product
portfolio. VenaCure, AngioDynamics' precision laser system for the treatment of
severe varicose veins, continues to post robust sales growth. The Company also
had strong market penetration with its Morpheus(TM) CT PICC (peripherally
inserted central catheter), which was launched nationally in September 2004.

Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 rose 71% to $1.0 million, or
$0.09 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $0.6 million, or $0.06
per diluted share, for the fiscal 2004 second quarter.

"Our financial results for the second quarter were rock-solid with excellent
sales, expanding gross margins and improved earnings despite increased expenses
resulting in large part from our operating as an independent public company,"
said Eamonn P.


<PAGE>

Hobbs, president and CEO of AngioDynamics. "Gross margin was 56.0%, compared
with 51.4% for the same period last year, due to a product mix weighted towards
high margin disposables, lower material costs, and modest price increases
implemented earlier in the year. Lower material costs resulted from purchase
volume discounts with a major supplier negotiated in the second fiscal quarter
of 2005, retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. Gross margin benefited
0.5% during the current period. Our goal is to reach a gross margin level of
between 60%-65%in the next five years."

Mr. Hobbs continued, "VenaCure sales have been on an accelerating growth path,
and we believe that the recent reimbursement levels set by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) beginning January 1, 2005 support our
competitive position in the marketplace with a win-win-win solution for
patients, physicians and third-party payers. We also are very excited about the
launch of our new Morpheus CT PICC and its reception from the interventional
radiology community. The benefits of this product are immediately apparent to
physicians as it gives increased flexibility to administer medications and to
perform CT imaging using one PICC line, avoiding the need for a second access
site while providing patient comfort, saving time and reducing costs."

Cash and cash equivalents were $11.8 million and the Company held short-term
debt securities of $10.4 million at November 27, 2004, compared to $1.7 million
and $0.7 million, respectively at May 29, 2004. The increase is due primarily to
the receipt in June 2004 of the proceeds from the Company's initial public
offering.

For the twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2004, net sales were $27.5 million,
up 22% from $22.5 million for the comparable 2003 period. The increase was due
to robust sales from the Company's VenaCure and Morpheus products and to
increased sales of the other existing product lines. Net earnings for the
twenty-six weeks ended November 27, 2004 were $1.8 million, up 100% compared
with net earnings of $0.9 million for the comparable fiscal 2004 period and
diluted earnings per common share increased to $.15 from $.10.

Mr. Hobbs continued, "We are adjusting our guidance slightly upwards from 17% to
20% sales growth to a range of 20% to 21% for fiscal 2005. We also expect
diluted weighted shares outstanding to be between 12.1 million and 12.3 million
for the fiscal year. Given our operational improvements, our understanding of
the IPVD space and our ability to provide new products tailored to the needs of
our physician customers, we remain extremely confident in the near and long-term
outlook for the business."
