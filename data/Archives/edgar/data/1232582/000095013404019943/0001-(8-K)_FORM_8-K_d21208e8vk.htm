<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(a)&nbsp;Combined Contribution and Purchase and Sale Agreement

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;27, 2004, Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a definitive
agreement with FGSB Master Corp., FGSB Master LLC, Lismore Associates, L.P. and Rolling Rock GP to
acquire a 21-property, 4,094-room hotel portfolio for $250&nbsp;million. The selling entities are
controlled by affiliates of the Fisher Brothers, Gordon Getty Trust, and George Soros, collectively
as majority partners (&#147;FGS&#148;), and certain members of the Company&#146;s senior management team as
minority partners. The minority partners, Lismore Associates, L.P. and Rolling Rock GP, are wholly
owned and controlled by members of the Company&#146;s senior management team. In total, FGS owns
approximately 78% of the selling entities while Company management (through Lismore Associates,
L.P. and Rolling Rock GP) owns approximately 22%.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The $250&nbsp;million total consideration is comprised of approximately $35.0&nbsp;million in cash, the
issuance of approximately $50.3&nbsp;million worth of operating partnership units, and the assumption of
approximately $164.7&nbsp;million in debt at a fixed average interest rate of 7.4%. The operating
partnership units were priced at $10.07 using a 20-day average closing price calculated five
business days prior the execution of the agreement. FGS will receive approximately 50% of their
portion of the total consideration in operating partnership units and 50% in cash. Company
management will receive approximately 100% of their net consideration in operating partnership
units.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The hotel properties have combined annual gross revenues of approximately $116.3&nbsp;million. The
acquisition is expected to close by February&nbsp;2005. Remington Lodging &#038; Hospitality, an affiliate
of the current manager of the properties, will operate the hotels.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The core portfolio consists of the following hotels: Houston Embassy Suites Galleria; Houston
Hilton NASA/Clearlake in Houston, TX; St. Petersburg Hilton in St. Petersburg, FL; West Palm Beach
Embassy Suites and Admiralty Office Building in West Palm Beach, FL; Sheraton Minneapolis West in
Minnetonka, MN; Beverly Hills Crowne Plaza in Los Angeles, CA; Key West Crowne Plaza LaConcha in
Key West, FL; Rockland Radisson Hotel Boston/South Shore in Rockland, MA; Fort Worth Radisson in
Fort Worth, TX; Indianapolis Airport Radisson Hotel in Indianapolis, IN; Indianapolis Radisson
Hotel City Centre in Indianapolis, IN; Milford Radisson in Milford, MA; and the Historic Inns in
Annapolis, MD.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company designated the remaining eight smaller hotels as non-core properties and is evaluating
their strategic fit, sale, or re-branding opportunities. These hotels include: the Hyannis Ramada
Inn Regency in Hyannis, MA; Coral Gables Holiday Inn in Coral Gables, FL; Warner Robins Ramada Inn
in Warner Robins, GA; Yarmouth Gull Wing Suites in South Yarmouth, MA; Commack Howard Johnson in
Commack, NY; Westbury

in Dallas, TX.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has deposited $2&nbsp;million under the contribution and purchase and sale agreement, and
this deposit is refundable only in limited circumstances. Consummation of the transaction is
subject to closing conditions, including receipt of third party consents and receipt by Company of
the capital necessary to consummate the transaction, as provided in the Contribution and Purchase
and Sale Agreement. Accordingly, the Company can give no assurance that all or part of the
transaction will be consummated or that, if consummated, it would follow all of the terms set forth
in the agreements governing the transaction.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A Form of the Contribution and Purchase and Sale Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;10.20.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;Series&nbsp;B Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;27, 2004, the Company also entered into a Series&nbsp;B Cumulative Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement for the sale of up to $75&nbsp;million in Series&nbsp;B cumulative
convertible redeemable preferred stock of the Company to Security Capital Preferred Growth
Incorporated (&#147;Security Capital&#148;). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Security Capital may
purchase up to 5,162,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock of the Company and up to 2,285,865
shares of Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock of the Company, in each case at a per-share price of $10.07.
The two series of preferred stock are identical except with respect to voting rights and
convertibility features and are referred to herein collectively as the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock.
Each share of Series&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
into the number of shares of common stock of the Company obtained by dividing $10.07 by the
conversion price then in effect. The initial conversion price of the Class&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock is
$10.07 and is subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Articles Supplementary relating the
Class&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock. The Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock will automatically convert into Series
B-1 Preferred Stock on a share-for share basis immediately upon the earliest to occur of (i)
approval of the stockholders of the Company as required by the applicable rules of the New York
Stock Exchange or (ii)&nbsp;a determination by the board of directors of the Company that such
stockholder vote is not required.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The liquidation preference for both series of preferred stock is set at $10.07 per share, which is
the same as the operating partnership unit pricing for the aforementioned 21-property hotel
acquisition. The preferred dividend for both series of preferred stock to be issued under this
purchase agreement is set at the greater of $0.14 per share, or the prevailing common stock
dividend, plus in the case of the Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock, an additional dividend of $0.05015
per share beginning January&nbsp;1, 2009, if (i)&nbsp;the conversion of the Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock into
Series&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock has not been completed and (ii)&nbsp;the price at which the common stock of
the Company is then trading exceeds $10.07 per share.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The $75&nbsp;million preferred stock private placement is a two-stage transaction. The first tranche is
for the sale of $20&nbsp;million in Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, with the initial $10&nbsp;million scheduled to
be funded on December&nbsp;30, 2004, and the remaining $10&nbsp;million being available for disbursement by
June&nbsp;30, 2005. The second tranche is for $55&nbsp;million and its availability is contingent upon the
closing of the aforementioned 21-property acquisition provided the
closing occurs prior to March&nbsp;31, 2005. Of the second tranche, initially, $14.7
million will be funded, at Security Capital&#146;s election, at the closing of the aforementioned
21-property acquisition, with another $20&nbsp;million funded by June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the remainder of the
second tranche will be available for disbursement by December&nbsp;23, 2005. Proceeds from the
issuance may be used specifically for the aforementioned 21-property acquisition or drawn over time
for general corporate purposes, including new acquisitions or debt repayment.

Company has agreed to cause a registration statement covering the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock and the
common stock into which the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock is convertible to be filed within 30&nbsp;days
after a request to do so by the holders of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, provided that the holders
may make such a request only with respect to $20,000,000 or more of issued and outstanding Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock.
