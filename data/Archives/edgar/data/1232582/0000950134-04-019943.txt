<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(a)&nbsp;Combined Contribution and Purchase and Sale Agreement

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;27, 2004, Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a definitive
agreement with FGSB Master Corp., FGSB Master LLC, Lismore Associates, L.P. and Rolling Rock GP to
acquire a 21-property, 4,094-room hotel portfolio for $250&nbsp;million. The selling entities are
controlled by affiliates of the Fisher Brothers, Gordon Getty Trust, and George Soros, collectively
as majority partners (&#147;FGS&#148;), and certain members of the Company&#146;s senior management team as
minority partners. The minority partners, Lismore Associates, L.P. and Rolling Rock GP, are wholly
owned and controlled by members of the Company&#146;s senior management team. In total, FGS owns
approximately 78% of the selling entities while Company management (through Lismore Associates,
L.P. and Rolling Rock GP) owns approximately 22%.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The $250&nbsp;million total consideration is comprised of approximately $35.0&nbsp;million in cash, the
issuance of approximately $50.3&nbsp;million worth of operating partnership units, and the assumption of
approximately $164.7&nbsp;million in debt at a fixed average interest rate of 7.4%. The operating
partnership units were priced at $10.07 using a 20-day average closing price calculated five
business days prior the execution of the agreement. FGS will receive approximately 50% of their
portion of the total consideration in operating partnership units and 50% in cash. Company
management will receive approximately 100% of their net consideration in operating partnership
units.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The hotel properties have combined annual gross revenues of approximately $116.3&nbsp;million. The
acquisition is expected to close by February&nbsp;2005. Remington Lodging &#038; Hospitality, an affiliate
of the current manager of the properties, will operate the hotels.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The core portfolio consists of the following hotels: Houston Embassy Suites Galleria; Houston
Hilton NASA/Clearlake in Houston, TX; St. Petersburg Hilton in St. Petersburg, FL; West Palm Beach
Embassy Suites and Admiralty Office Building in West Palm Beach, FL; Sheraton Minneapolis West in
Minnetonka, MN; Beverly Hills Crowne Plaza in Los Angeles, CA; Key West Crowne Plaza LaConcha in
Key West, FL; Rockland Radisson Hotel Boston/South Shore in Rockland, MA; Fort Worth Radisson in
Fort Worth, TX; Indianapolis Airport Radisson Hotel in Indianapolis, IN; Indianapolis Radisson
Hotel City Centre in Indianapolis, IN; Milford Radisson in Milford, MA; and the Historic Inns in
Annapolis, MD.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company designated the remaining eight smaller hotels as non-core properties and is evaluating
their strategic fit, sale, or re-branding opportunities. These hotels include: the Hyannis Ramada
Inn Regency in Hyannis, MA; Coral Gables Holiday Inn in Coral Gables, FL; Warner Robins Ramada Inn
in Warner Robins, GA; Yarmouth Gull Wing Suites in South Yarmouth, MA; Commack Howard Johnson in
Commack, NY; Westbury

in Dallas, TX.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has deposited $2&nbsp;million under the contribution and purchase and sale agreement, and
this deposit is refundable only in limited circumstances. Consummation of the transaction is
subject to closing conditions, including receipt of third party consents and receipt by Company of
the capital necessary to consummate the transaction, as provided in the Contribution and Purchase
and Sale Agreement. Accordingly, the Company can give no assurance that all or part of the
transaction will be consummated or that, if consummated, it would follow all of the terms set forth
in the agreements governing the transaction.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A Form of the Contribution and Purchase and Sale Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit&nbsp;10.20.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(b)&nbsp;Series&nbsp;B Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;27, 2004, the Company also entered into a Series&nbsp;B Cumulative Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement for the sale of up to $75&nbsp;million in Series&nbsp;B cumulative
convertible redeemable preferred stock of the Company to Security Capital Preferred Growth
Incorporated (&#147;Security Capital&#148;). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Security Capital may
purchase up to 5,162,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock of the Company and up to 2,285,865
shares of Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock of the Company, in each case at a per-share price of $10.07.
The two series of preferred stock are identical except with respect to voting rights and
convertibility features and are referred to herein collectively as the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock.
Each share of Series&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
into the number of shares of common stock of the Company obtained by dividing $10.07 by the
conversion price then in effect. The initial conversion price of the Class&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock is
$10.07 and is subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Articles Supplementary relating the
Class&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock. The Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock will automatically convert into Series
B-1 Preferred Stock on a share-for share basis immediately upon the earliest to occur of (i)
approval of the stockholders of the Company as required by the applicable rules of the New York
Stock Exchange or (ii)&nbsp;a determination by the board of directors of the Company that such
stockholder vote is not required.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The liquidation preference for both series of preferred stock is set at $10.07 per share, which is
the same as the operating partnership unit pricing for the aforementioned 21-property hotel
acquisition. The preferred dividend for both series of preferred stock to be issued under this
purchase agreement is set at the greater of $0.14 per share, or the prevailing common stock
dividend, plus in the case of the Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock, an additional dividend of $0.05015
per share beginning January&nbsp;1, 2009, if (i)&nbsp;the conversion of the Series&nbsp;B-2 Preferred Stock into
Series&nbsp;B-1 Preferred Stock has not been completed and (ii)&nbsp;the price at which the common stock of
the Company is then trading exceeds $10.07 per share.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The $75&nbsp;million preferred stock private placement is a two-stage transaction. The first tranche is
for the sale of $20&nbsp;million in Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, with the initial $10&nbsp;million scheduled to
be funded on December&nbsp;30, 2004, and the remaining $10&nbsp;million being available for disbursement by
June&nbsp;30, 2005. The second tranche is for $55&nbsp;million and its availability is contingent upon the
closing of the aforementioned 21-property acquisition provided the
closing occurs prior to March&nbsp;31, 2005. Of the second tranche, initially, $14.7
million will be funded, at Security Capital&#146;s election, at the closing of the aforementioned
21-property acquisition, with another $20&nbsp;million funded by June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the remainder of the
second tranche will be available for disbursement by December&nbsp;23, 2005. Proceeds from the
issuance may be used specifically for the aforementioned 21-property acquisition or drawn over time
for general corporate purposes, including new acquisitions or debt repayment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The information set forth under Item&nbsp;1.01(b) of this report is incorporated herein by reference.
The issuance of all Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock will be affected in reliance upon an exemption form
registration provided by Section&nbsp;4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, the
Company has agreed to cause a registration statement covering the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock and the
common stock into which the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock is convertible to be filed within 30&nbsp;days
after a request to do so by the holders of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, provided that the holders
may make such a request only with respect to $20,000,000 or more of issued and outstanding Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock.

to have elected not to cure, remove or discharge such Objections, and Operating
Partnership shall elect either (1) to waive such Objections without any

which case the Deposit shall be promptly returned to Operating Partnership and
the Parties shall be released from all further obligations hereunder except

Property to or cause to be filed or recorded against any of the Acquired Assets

of the Properties or take any other action which may affect or modify the status
of title without Operating Partnership's prior written consent. All title
matters revealed by the Title Commitments, UCC Reports and Surveys and not
objected to or waived by Operating Partnership as provided above (other than any
Encumbrance on any of the Acquired Equity Interests, except for the security
interests securing the Mezzanine Loan) shall be deemed Permitted Exceptions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Operating Partnership shall not be required to
take title to any Property (directly or indirectly) subject to any Encumbrance
which may arise subsequent to the effective date of the Title Commitments, UCC
Reports and Surveys examined by Operating Partnership during the Title Review
Period. With respect to any affidavit or indemnity given by an Owner Party
pursuant to Section 7.2(g) below with respect to unfiled mechanics or
materialmen's liens, any costs subsequently incurred by such Owner Party with
respect to the matters covered by such affidavit or indemnity shall be
reimbursed by the Operating Partnership promptly on demand.

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state in which it
was organized, has all requisite powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals to carry

                                       20

Laws.

            (b) Authorization and Execution. The execution, delivery and
performance of each Transaction Document by each Owner Party that is a party
thereto has been duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of such
Owner Party. Each Transaction Document to which any Owner Party is a party has
been (or will be) duly executed and delivered by such Owner Party, constitutes
(or will constitute) a valid and binding agreement of such Owner Party and is
(or will be) enforceable against such Owner Party in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditor's rights generally and by general equitable principles. The Person
executing each Transaction Document on behalf of a Owner Party has (or will
have) the authority to do so. The Restructuring has been, or will have been as
of the Closing Date, duly authorized by all necessary actions on the part of the
Owners.

            (c) Non-contravention. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(c), the
execution and delivery of, and performance by each Owner Party of its
obligations under each Transaction Document to which such Owner Party is a party

in the creation of any lien or other Encumbrance on any asset of any such Owner
Party or require any consent, approval or vote of any court or Governmental
Authority that has not been given or taken, and does not remain effective.

            (d) Investment Representations and Warranties.

                  (i) Each Owner and each Beneficial Owner is an "accredited
investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities
Act. Each Owner understands the risks of, and other considerations relating to,
the acquisition of the Units. Each Owner and Beneficial Owner by reason of its
business and financial experience (together with the business and financial
experience of those persons, if any, retained by it to represent or advise it
with respect to its investment in the Units) (A) has such knowledge,
sophistication and experience in financial and business matters and in making
investment decisions of this type, (B) is capable of evaluating the merits and

and of making an informed investment decision, (C) is capable of protecting its
own interest or has engaged representatives or advisors to assist it in
protecting its interests and (D) is capable of bearing the economic risk of such
investment.

                  (ii) The Units to be issued to each Beneficial Owner will be
acquired for its own account for investment only and not with a view to, or with
any intention of, a distribution or resale thereof, in whole or in part, or the
grant of any participation therein.

                  (iii) Each Owner acknowledges (for itself and for its
Beneficial Owners) that (A) the Units to be issued have not been registered
under the Securities Act or state securities laws by reason of a specific
exemption or exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, (B) Company's reliance on such exemptions

                                       21
<PAGE>

is predicated in part on the accuracy and completeness of the representations
and warranties of Owner contained in this Agreement, (C) such Units, therefore,
cannot be resold unless registered under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws (unless an exemption from registration is available), (D) there
is no public market for such Units, and (E) Company has no obligation or
intention to register such Units for resale under the Securities Act or any
state securities laws or to take any action that would make available any
exemption from the registration requirements of such laws. Owner by this
Agreement acknowledges (for itself and for each Beneficial Owner) that because
of the restrictions on transfer or assignment of such Units to be issued
hereunder (such restrictions on transfer or assignment being set forth in this
Agreement and the Operating Partnership Agreement), each Beneficial Owner may
have to bear the economic risk of the investment commitment evidenced by this
Agreement and any Units acquired by this Agreement for an indefinite period of
time, although (x) the Units may be redeemed at the request of the holder
thereof for cash or (at the option of the general partner of Operating
Partnership) for Common Stock of Company pursuant to the terms of the Operating
Partnership Agreement and (y) Company and Beneficial Owner will execute and
deliver a Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached to this Agreement
as Exhibit U.

      The address set forth for each Owner and Beneficial Owner in this
Agreement is the address of such Person's principal place of business or
residence, as applicable, and such Person has no present intention of becoming a
resident of any country, state or jurisdiction other than the country and state
in which principal place of business or residence, as applicable, is sited.

                  (iv) Each Owner and Beneficial Owner has received and reviewed
or has been given the opportunity to receive and review (A) the Company SEC
Reports, (B) the Operating Partnership Agreement and (C) Company's
Organizational Documents prior to executing this Agreement. Each Owner
acknowledges (for itself and for each Beneficial Owner) that it is satisfied
with the information that it has received. Each Owner and each Beneficial Owner
has had an opportunity to ask questions of and receive information and answers
from Company concerning Company, Operating Partnership, the Units and the Common
Stock of Company into which the Units may be redeemed and to assess and evaluate
any information supplied to such Person by Company, and all such questions have
been answered and all such information has been provided to the full
satisfaction of such Person.

                  (v) No Owner and no Beneficial Owner (i) is required to
register as a "broker" or "dealer" in accordance with the provisions of the
Exchange Act or (ii) directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
controls or has any other association with (within the meaning of Article I of
the By-laws of the NASD) any member firm of the NASD.

            (e) Owners Are Not "Foreign Persons." Owners and Beneficial Owners
are not "foreign persons" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code (i.e.,
Owner is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, foreign
estate or foreign person as those terms are defined in the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder).

            (f) Working Capital. Schedule 3.1(f) contains a schedule of working
capital (and its components) ("Schedule of Combining Working Capital") as of
September 30, 2004, October 31, 2004 and November 30, 2004, reflecting a

<PAGE>

Acquired Partnership and the Property has been operated in the ordinary course
of business. All trade payables included on the Schedule of Combining Working
Capital represent amounts actually owed to venders, suppliers, and other Persons
relating to the Properties and which arose in the ordinary course of business.
All Inventory included on the Schedule of Combining Working Capital consists of
food, beverages, linens, towels, paper goods, soaps, cleaning supplies, china,
glassware, silverware, and miscellaneous guest supplies, engineering cleaning
supplies and the like, all of which is merchantable and fit for the purpose for
which it was procured, and none of which is obsolete, damaged, or defective. Any
Inventory that has been written down has either been written off or written down
to its net realizable value. There has been no change in Inventory valuation
standards or methods in the prior three years. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, since September 30, 2004, no Partnership has done any of the
following:

                  (i) delayed or postponed the payment of accounts payable or
other Liabilities outside of the ordinary course of business or made any
payments on the Loans or the Mezzanine Loan in advance of the scheduled
payments.

                  (ii) declared, set aside, or paid any dividend or made any
distribution with respect to its Equity Interests (whether in cash or in kind)

      6.1 Operating Agreements/Leased Property Agreements/Off-Site Facility
Agreements/Management Agreements. Owners shall cause the Partnerships to not
enter into any new management agreement, Operating Agreement, Leased Property
Agreement, Occupancy Agreement, Off-Site Facility Agreement, or any agreements
modifying any of the Contracts, Management Agreements, Franchise Agreements or
the Ground Leases unless (a) any such agreement or modification will not bind
any Company Party or Partnership and will not constitute any portion of the
Property after the date of Closing or is subject to termination on not more than
thirty (30) days' notice without penalty, or (b) Owners have obtained Operating
Partnership's prior written consent to such agreement or modification, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be deemed
granted if not objected to in writing within five (5) days after receipt of such

lapse of coverage, by another policy or policies providing coverage at least as

from time to time, upon reasonable advance written notice from Company, and at
Company's sole cost and expense, provide Company and its representatives with
reasonable access to all of Owners' information and documentation relating to
the Acquired Interests, Acquired Companies and Properties, provided the same
shall then be in Owner's (or an Affiliate of Owner's) possession pertaining to
the period from January 1, 2000 through the Closing Date, which information is
relevant and reasonably necessary, in the opinion of the outside accountants of
Company, to enable Company and Company's outside accountants to file financial

Company's cost) with any or all of (a) Rule 3-05 or 3-14 of Regulation S-X of
the SEC; (b) any other rule issued by the SEC and applicable to Company or its

and Properties.

      6.8 Rights of First Refusal. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the

However, to provide for the greatest degree of closing certainty and Ground
Lessor relationship management, the Parties have agreed to (i) notify some of
the holders of such rights of this Agreement and the Transactions, (ii) allow
such holders the opportunity to assert any perceived claim, and (iii) provide a
mechanism in this Agreement to exclude from the Transactions any Property for
which such a right is exercised. Accordingly, the Parties shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the waiver of any and all rights of
first refusal or options related to any Real Property set forth on Schedule
3.3(a). To the extent that any such waiver is not obtained and any such right of
first refusal or option is exercised by the holder thereof with respect to any
Real Property, such Real Property or the associated Owner Entity, as the case
may be, shall not be contributed or sold hereunder by Owners and the Sale
Consideration and/or the Contribution Consideration shall be reduced by the
amount of such Sale Consideration and/or Contribution Consideration allocated to
such Real Property as set forth on Exhibit A. In such event, Owners shall pay
all costs and expenses associated with yield maintenance and/or defeasance costs

(iii) retain possession of the Owner Possession Current Assets for the benefit
of the Operating Lessee (or its designee), (iv) use all commercially reasonable
efforts to collect all accounts receivable and otherwise cause the liquidation

the Owner Possession Current Liabilities as soon as commercially practicable,
which the Parties expect to be within 60 days after the Closing Date, and (v)

<PAGE>

                  (i) any breach, violation or inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty made by Company or Operating Partnership in this Agreement (without
giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or concepts of similar
import or any qualification or limitations as to monetary amount or value
contained therein), including any certificates delivered hereunder; and

                  (ii) any breach, violation or inaccuracy of any covenant,
agreement or other obligation of Company or Operating Partnership in this
Agreement; and

                  (iii) the Scheduled Litigation and all Pre-Closing Ordinary
Liabilities.

      9.3 Limitations to Indemnification.

            (a) The indemnification obligations of a Party (i) with respect to
any breach, violation or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
such Party contained in this Agreement, other than with respect to those
contained in Section 3.2(c) and Section 3.2(e), shall survive the Closing for a
period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, (ii) with respect to
indemnification obligations relating to Sections 6.12, 6.13, 6.17, 6.18, 6.20,
8.3, 9.2(a)(iii), 9.4 and 11.1 and Article XII, shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, and (iii) with respect to all other indemnification obligations,
shall survive the Closing for three years following the Closing Date. All claims
for indemnification made within the specified survival period shall survive the
expiration of such periods.

            (b) (i) Each of the representations and warranties contained in
Articles III-IV and their various subparagraphs are intended for the benefit of
Company and Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and Owners on the other
hand, and may be waived in whole or in part, by them, but only by an instrument
in writing signed by them. All rights to indemnification shall survive the
Closing of the Transaction as provided in Section 9.3(a), but shall be limited
as provided in Section 9.3(b)(ii) to the extent that the indemnitee gives the
indemnitor written notice prior to Closing of same, or the indemnitee otherwise
obtains knowledge of same prior to Closing, and the indemnitor nevertheless
elects to close this transaction. Any such written notice shall state in the
first paragraph thereof and in all capitalized letters that "THIS NOTICE IS
GIVEN PURSUANT TO THE COMBINED CONTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT MADE
AS OF DECEMBER 23, 2004, AND RELATES TO AN INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM UNDER SECTION
9.3(b)."

            (ii) The indemnification obligations contained in this Agreement of
Company and Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and Owners, on the other
hand, (1) shall not survive Closing with respect to any such Losses (which
Losses shall be deemed waived), other than Losses resulting from a breach of the
representation and warranty contained in Section 3.2(c), if such was known by
the indemnitee prior to the Effective Date, and (2) shall survive Closing as
provided in Section 9.3(a) but shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate (and
shall be subject to the Threshold as provided in Section 9.3(c) with respect to
Losses resulting from any inaccuracy, breach or violation of any representation
or warranty other than those contained in Section 3.2(c) made by such breaching
Party in this Agreement) if same becomes known to the indemnitee between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date and the

                                       53
<PAGE>

indemnitee does not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1. Nothing
in this Section 9.3(b)(ii) shall limit (1) the indemnitee's right not to proceed
to and conclude Closing hereunder or terminate pursuant to and in accordance
with Article X or (2) the indemnification obligations of an indemnitor other
than with respect to those described in this Section 9.3(b)(ii).

            For purposes of certainty, set forth below are three illustrations
as to the manner in which the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.3(b)(ii)
would operate:

            Illustration No. 1 (Post-Signing Period Breaches of $4.5 million)

            If (A) as of the Effective Date, Company had knowledge of one or
more circumstances that would otherwise provide a claim for indemnification but
for the application of this Section 9.3(b)(ii) (each a "Breach") in this
Agreement ("Pre-Signing Breaches"), (B) between the Effective Date and the
Closing Date, the Company obtains knowledge of one or more Breaches made by the
Owners in this Agreement or obtains knowledge that one or more Breaches has
become untrue or inaccurate ("Post-Singing Breaches"), the Losses in respect of
which are $4.5 million, and (C) notwithstanding such Pre-Signing Breaches and
Post-Signing Breaches and the Losses in respect thereof, Company elects to
complete the Transactions, then (a) Owners shall not be obligated, liable or
responsible to Company for any Losses in respect of the Pre-Signing Breaches,
(b) Owners shall be liable with respect to the first $2.0 million of such Losses
in respect of Post-Signing Breaches ($200,000 of which shall be applied to the
Threshold with respect to any applicable representations and warranties), and
(y) to the extent that the amount of such Losses is agreed upon prior to
Closing, the same shall be credited against the Sale Consideration and (z) to
the extent that the amount of such Losses is not agreed upon prior to Closing,
such Losses shall be subject to indemnification in favor of Company pursuant to
Section 9.1, and (c) Owners shall not be obligated, liable or responsible to
Company for the remaining $2.5 million of Losses in excess of $2.0 million.

            Illustration No. 2 (Post-Signing Period Breaches of $2.0 million)

            If (A) as of the Effective Date, Company had knowledge of one or
more Pre-Signing Breaches, (B) between the Effective Date and the Closing Date,
Company obtains knowledge of one or more Post-Signing Breaches, the Losses in
respect of which are $2.0 million, and (C) notwithstanding such Pre-Signing
Breaches and Post-Signing Breaches and the Losses in respect thereof, Company
elects to complete the Transactions, then (a) Owners shall not be obligated,
liable or responsible to Company for any Losses in respect of the Pre-Signing
Breaches, and (b) Owners shall be liable with respect to $2.0 million of such
Losses in respect of Post-Signing Breaches ($200,000 of which shall be applied
to the Threshold with respect to any applicable representations and warranties),
and (y) to the extent that the amount of such Losses is agreed upon prior to
Closing, the same shall be credited against the Sale Consideration and (z) to
the extent that the amount of such Losses is not agreed upon prior to Closing,
such Losses shall be subject to indemnification in favor of Company pursuant to
Section 9.1.

            Illustration No. 3 (Post-Signing Period Breaches of $100,000)

            If (A) as of the Effective Date, Company had knowledge of one or
more Pre-Signing Breaches, (B) between the Effective Date and the Closing Date,
Company obtains

                                       54
<PAGE>

knowledge of one or more Post-Signing Breaches, the Losses in respect of which
are $100,000, and (C) notwithstanding such Pre-Signing Breaches, and
Post-Signing Breaches and the Losses in respect thereof, Company elects to
complete the Transactions, then (a) Owners shall not be obligated, liable or
responsible to Company for any Losses in respect of the Pre-Signing Breaches,
and (b) the amount of Losses in respect of Post-Signing Breaches ($100,000)
shall be applied to the Threshold with respect to any applicable representations
and warranties and shall be subject to indemnification in favor of Company
pursuant to Section 9.1 (but only to the extent that additional Losses resulting
from one or more Breaches hereunder are discovered by Company after the Closing,
but before the expiration of the survival periods set forth in Section 9.3(a),
exceed $100,000).

            (c) (i) Neither Owners, on the one hand, nor Company, on the other
hand, shall have any liability under Section 9.1(a)(i) (other than claims
relating to Section 3.2(c)) or Section 9.2(a)(i), respectively, unless, in each
case, the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which either such Parties
would, but for this proviso, in the aggregate be liable exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) (the
"Threshold"), subject to reduction on account of previous Post-Signing Breaches
relating to applicable representations and warranties as provided above, and
then to the extent of all of such Losses (i.e., from the first dollar of such
Losses); and (ii) such Party's aggregate liability under such Sections shall in
no event exceed Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the "Cap").

            (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
except in the case of actual fraud by a Party, the liability of each Party
resulting from the breach or default by such Party shall be limited to actual
damages incurred by the injured Party and (ii) except in the case of actual
fraud by a Party, the Parties waive their rights to recover from the other
Parties consequential, punitive, exemplary, and speculative damages or any other
remedies available in contract, tort, law or otherwise. The Parties shall have
the right to adjust the Sale Consideration by the reasonably estimated amount of
(i) any indemnification claims for Losses resulting from any inaccuracy, breach
or violation of any representation or warranty made by a Party in this Agreement
which in the aggregate exceed the Threshold and that become known between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date and (ii) any other indemnification claims
known at Closing, and in respect of both (i) and (ii) other than any such claims
that expressly do not survive Closing.

            (e) Recourse: The indemnity obligation of the Operating Partnership,
on one hand, and Owners, on the other hand, shall be with full recourse to the
indemnifying party. In addition, Owners' indemnification obligations shall also
provide recourse as follows: First to the collateral that remains subject to the
Pledge Agreements, and then, to the extent that such obligations are unsatisfied
from such collateral, to the Guaranty.

      9.4 Notification of Claims.

            (a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"), shall promptly notify the Party liable for
such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any pending or
threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has determined has given
or could reasonable give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement
(including a pending or threatened claim or demand

                                       55
<PAGE>

asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a
"Third Party Claim"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure, except that
notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty must
be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable period specified in
Section 9.3(a) for giving written notification.

            (b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to assume the defense and control of any Third
Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own
counsel and at its own expense. Each Owner or Company, as the case may be,
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten Business Days after notice of any
Third Party Claim, assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Party, subject to
the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at any time
prior to the compromise, settlement or final determination thereof. The
Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim that does not require
any admission of liability by the Indemnified Party without the consent of any
Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay (up to the
Cap, if applicable) or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such
settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement,
(ii) not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect the conduct of
any Indemnified Party's business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any
settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of any
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim.

            (c) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim
for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party within 30 days following its receipt of such notice if the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected the claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice.

extend the Outside Date on five (5) days prior written notice to the other Party

this Agreement to be satisfied on or prior to Closing, and Company/Operating
Partnership or Owners, as the case may be, reasonably believes that such closing
conditions can be satisfied within such extension period; provided further that,
in each case, the terminating Party is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement in a manner that shall have contributed to the occurrence

any portion thereof, is subject to any actual or threatened taking pursuant to
the power of eminent domain or any proposed sale in lieu thereof or is subject

Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further force and effect, and,
subject to the delivery of the Deposit to the Party entitled thereto hereunder,
no Party shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement
except for those expressly stated to survive the termination hereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Deposit shall be
returned to Operating Partnership in all events of termination of this Agreement
except to the extent any such termination is solely the result of a breach by
Operating Partnership and/or Company. Except in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 10.1(c) above, no Party shall have any obligation to

                                 TAX PROTECTION

      11.1 Restrictions on Transfer of Contributed Properties/Reduction of
Indebtedness by Company.

            (a) Company by this Agreement agrees that, during the Protected
Period, it shall not nor shall it cause the Operating Partnership or any of
their subsidiaries to sell, transfer, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or
any portion of their interest in the Contributed Properties, or engage in a
merger, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or a liquidation or
dissolution of Company, Operating Partnership or any of Company's or Operating
Partnership's subsidiaries, if as a result of which a Beneficial Owner or its
Protected Transferees will recognize any Built-in-Gain for federal income tax
purposes (a "Taxable Event"). Company by this Agreement further agrees that in
the event it causes a Taxable Event to occur at any time during the Protected
Period, Company shall pay or shall cause the Operating Partnership or their
subsidiaries to pay to each affected Beneficial Owner and its Protected
Transferees an amount equal to the Taxable Event Payment (as defined below).
Upon the occurrence of a Taxable Event, Operating Partnership shall promptly
notify the affected Beneficial Owner and each of its Protected Transferees to
the extent the identity and address of such Protected Transferee is known by
Operating Partnership. Upon the later of (i) 10 Business Days of the receipt by
Operating Partnership from the Beneficial Owner or Protected Transferee of the
information required to determine the Taxable Event Payment or (ii) 10 Business
Days before the next estimated tax payment is due; the Operating Partnership
will pay the applicable Taxable Event Payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the applicable Person. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Taxable Event Payment" means as to each affected Beneficial Owner or
Protected Transferee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the federal, state, and
local income Taxes payable by such person resulting from the recognition of
Built-in-Gain as a result of the occurrence of the Taxable Event (taking into
account the deductibility of state and local taxes for federal and state tax
purposes) and (ii) an additional payment in an amount equal to the amount such
that, after payment by such Person of all Taxes (taking into account the
deductibility of state and local taxes for federal and state tax purposes) on
amounts received under clause (i) and this clause (ii), such Person retains an
amount equal to the amount described in clause (i).

                                       59
<PAGE>

            (b) Company covenants that the "traditional method" (without
curative allocations), as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.704-3(b), of allocating
income, gain, loss and deduction to account for the variation between the fair
market value and adjusted basis of the property for federal income tax purposes,
shall be used (i) with respect to the contribution of the Contributed
Properties, and (ii) with respect to any revaluation of the Contributed
Properties, pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sections  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) and 1.704 3(a)(6).

            (c) Company covenants that, subject to the exceptions provided
herein, it will not reduce or cause a reduction in the indebtedness secured by
the Contributed Properties that would trigger gain or at-risk capture to a
Beneficial Owner or its Protected Transferees (except for gains resulting from
normal amortization of existing debt as provided on the amortization schedule on
Schedule 11.1(c) and income allocated pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") due to amortization and
depreciation) during the Protected Period. Company by this Agreement further
agrees that in the event it breaches this covenant in Section 11.1(c) during the
Protected Period, Company shall pay or cause the Operating Partnership or their
subsidiaries to pay to each Beneficial Owner and its Protected Transferees an
amount equal to the Taxable Event Payment, computed as if the events set forth
in the preceding sentence were a Taxable Event.

            (d) No Taxable Event Payments or other liability or obligation of
Company or its affiliates shall be triggered pursuant to this Article XI for any
sale, transfer, distribution or disposition of the Properties other than
Contributed Properties or for any reduction of indebtedness secured by the
Properties other than Contributed Properties.

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions, obligations and
Liabilities of the Company and its affiliates provided in this Article XI shall
terminate and be of no force or effect as to any Beneficial Owner and its
Protected Transferees at such time that the Unit Sales Limitation is not
satisfied as to such Beneficial Owner and its Protected Transferees. The making
of a Taxable Event Payment by the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of
their affiliates under this Section 11.1 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of a Owner, its Beneficial Owners and its Protected Transferees with respect to
any tax liability incurred in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to permit a party to receive a double benefit or compensation respect
to a Taxable Event (it being understood and agreed that the payments referenced
in clauses (i) and (ii) in the definition of Taxable Event Payment in Section
11.1(a) above shall not be considered a "double benefit".

            (f) No Beneficial Owner or its Protected Transferees shall have any
right to participate in (i) any audit, conference or other proceeding with the
Internal Revenue Service or the relevant state or local authorities, or any
judicial proceedings concerning the determination of the tax liability of the
Company, the Operating Partnership or any of their subsidiaries, (ii) any
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing
authority in respect of any such proceeding or (iii) any compromise or
settlement of any adjustment or deficiency proposed, asserted or assessed as a
result of any such proceeding.

            (g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article XI and for
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Article XI shall not apply to the
Designated Properties,

                                       60
<PAGE>

including any restrictions or limitations on the taxable disposition of the
Designated Properties or the prepayment, defeasance or other reduction of the
indebtedness applicable to the Designated Properties.

      12.10 Representations and Warranties. Each of Owners (with respect to

respect to Article IV) shall be deemed to have made representations and
warranties pursuant to this Agreement to the extent such representations or
warranties are made in accordance with Articles III or IV (respectively), the
bring-down certificates provided for in Article VII (which representations and
warranties will be given as of the Closing Date), the Owners' Estoppel or any
other similar instrument.

      12.11 Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent referred to in the definition thereof
contained in Section 1.1 of this Agreement has agreed to act as such for the
convenience of the Parties without fee or other charges for such services as
Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be liable: (a) to any of the Parties for
any act or omission to act except for its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence; (b) for any legal effect, insufficiency, or undesirability of any
instrument deposited with or delivered by Escrow Agent or exchanged by the
Parties hereunder, whether or not Escrow Agent prepared such instrument; (c) for
any loss or impairment of funds that have been deposited in escrow while those
funds are in the course of collection, or while those funds are on deposit in a
financial institution, if such loss or impairment results from the failure,
insolvency or suspension of a financial institution; (d) for the expiration of
any time limit or other consequence of delay, unless a properly executed written
instruction, accepted by Escrow Agent, has instructed Escrow Agent to comply
with said time limit; (e) for the default, error, action or omission of either
Party to the escrow. Escrow Agent, in its capacity as escrow agent, shall be
entitled to rely on any document or paper received by it, believed by such
Escrow Agent, in good faith, to be bona fide and genuine. In the event of any
dispute as to the disposition of the Deposit or any other monies held in escrow,
or of any documents held in escrow, Escrow Agent may, if such Escrow Agent so
elects, interplead the matter by filing an interpleader action in a court of
general jurisdiction in the county or circuit where the Real Property is located
(to the jurisdiction of which both Parties do by this Agreement consent), and
pay into the registry of the court the Deposit, or deposit any such documents
with respect to which there is a dispute in the registry of such court,
whereupon such Escrow Agent shall be relieved and released from any further
liability as Escrow Agent hereunder. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for Escrow
Agent's compliance with any legal process, subpoena, writ, order, judgment and
decree of any court, whether issued with or without jurisdiction, and whether or
not subsequently vacated, modified, set aside or reversed.

            (b) On December 30, 2004, the Investor shall purchase 993,049 shares
of Series B Preferred Stock for $10.07 per share (equal to $10,000,003 in the

            (c) The Company shall have the option to sell to the Investor
993,049 additional shares (the "Section 1.2(c) Shares") of Series B Preferred
Stock for $10.07 per share (equal to $10,000,003 in the aggregate), and if the
Company does not exercise this option in full, then the Investor shall have the
option to purchase any unsold Section 1.2(c) shares from the Company for $10.07
per share, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.2(c).

            The Company may exercise its option to sell shares to the Investor
pursuant to this section 1.2(c) at any time, from time to time, prior to June
13, 2005 by delivery to the Investor of one or more irrevocable written notices
(each, a "Section 1.2(c) Closing Notice"), which notices shall specify (i) the
number of Section 1.2(c) Shares to be sold pursuant to such notice (which
number, with respect to any one such notice, shall not be less than 496,524) and
(ii) the Closing Date on which such sale shall take place (which date shall not
be less than six Business Days following the date of such notice, and shall not

any Section 1.2(c) Shares then remaining unsold, then the Investor shall have
the option to purchase any or all of such unsold Section 1.2(c) Shares. In such
event, (a) the Company shall deliver a written notice (the "Section 1.2(c)
Option Notice") to the Investor not later than June 15, 2005 stating that the
Investor has a purchase option pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) and specifying

delivering to the Company at any time prior to June 21, 2005 an irrevocable
written notice specifying the number of previously unsold Section 1.2(c) Shares
that the Investor shall purchase, and stating that such purchase shall take
place at a Closing on June 30, 2005. If the Company fails to timely deliver the
Section 1.2(c) Option Notice, then the notice date and Closing Date referred to
in clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence shall each be extended by a
number of Business Days equal to the number of Business Days that the Company
was deficient in delivering the Section 1.2(c) Option Notice.

            (d) Subject to the closing on or prior to March 31, 2005 of the
transactions contemplated by the Combined Contribution and Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated as of December 27, 2004 by and among the Company, the

Investor 5,461,767 additional shares (the "Section 1.2(d) Shares") of Series B
Preferred Stock for $10.07 per share (equal to $54,999,994 in the aggregate),
and if the Company does not exercise this option in full, then the Investor

Investor, the closing under the FGSB Portfolio Agreement has substantially
occurred as described in such agreement prior to January 1, 2006 (the "Investor
Option Trigger")), to purchase any unsold Section 1.2(d) shares from the Company
for $10.07 per share, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.2(d).

                                       5

            Subject to the occurrence of the Company Option Trigger, the Company
may exercise its option to sell shares to the Investor pursuant to this section
1.2(d) at any time, from time to time, prior to December 5, 2005 by delivery to
the Investor of one or more irrevocable written notices (each, a "Section 1.2(d)
Closing Notice"), which notices shall specify (i) the number of Section 1.2(d)
Shares to be sold pursuant to such notice (which number, with respect to any one
such notice, shall not be less than the lesser of (x) 496,524 and (y) the total
number of Section 1.2(d) Shares which remain unsold at such time) and (ii) the
Closing Date on which such sale shall take place (which date shall not be less
than six Business Days following the date of such notice (or, if such notice
covers more than 993,049 Section 1.2(d) Shares, 11 Business Days), and shall not
be later than December 23, 2005). Subject to the occurrence of the Investor
Option Trigger, in the event that, prior to December 6, 2005, all 5,461,767
Section 1.2(d) Shares have not been sold to the Investor and Section 1.2(d)
Closing Notices have not been delivered to the Investor with respect to any
Section 1.2(d) Shares then remaining unsold, then the Investor shall have the
option to purchase any or all of such unsold Section 1.2(d) Shares. In such
event, (a) the Company shall deliver a written notice (the "Section 1.2(d)
Option Notice") to the Investor not later than December 7, 2005 stating that the
Investor has a purchase option pursuant to this Section 1.2(d) and specifying
the number of Section 1.2(d) Shares covered by such option, and (b) the Investor
may exercise its option to purchase any unsold Section 1.2(d) shares by
delivering to the Company at any time prior to December 13, 2005 an irrevocable
written notice specifying the number of previously unsold Section 1.2(d) Shares
that the Investor shall purchase, and stating that such purchase shall take
place at a Closing on December 23, 2005. If the Company fails to timely deliver
the Section 1.2(d) Option Notice, then the notice date and Closing Date referred
to in clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence shall each be extended by
a number of Business Days equal to the number of Business Days that the Company
was deficient in delivering the Section 1.2(d) Option Notice.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1.2(d) to the
contrary, subject to the occurrence of the Investor Option Trigger, the Investor
shall also have the following options to purchase Section 1.2(d) shares (but
these options shall not increase the total number of Section 1.2(d) Shares
available for purchase by the Investor):

      (i)   On the date, if any, prior to January 1, 2006 that the Investor
            Option Trigger occurs, the Investor shall have the option to
            purchase up to 1,459,782 Section 1.2(d) Shares for $10.07 per share,
            if any Section 1.2(d) shares remain unsold as of such date. Promptly
            upon determining the date, if any, on which the Investor Option
            Trigger will likely occur (the "FGSB Target Closing Date"), the
            Company shall deliver a written notice (the "FGSB Closing Notice")
            to the Investor stating that the Investor has a purchase option
            pursuant to this Section 1.2(d)(i) and specifying the FGSB Target
            Closing Date (which date may not be less than 10 nor more than 20
            Business Days following delivery of such notice). The Investor may
            exercise its option pursuant to this Section 1.2(d)(i) by delivering
            to the Company at any time prior to the fifth Business Day following
            its receipt of a the FGSB Closing Notice an irrevocable written
            notice (and "FGSB Election Notice") specifying the number of Section
            1.2(d) Shares that the Investor shall purchase pursuant to this
            Section 1.2(d)(i). The Closing under this Section 1.2(d)(i) shall
            take place on the later of the FGSB Target Closing Date or the date
            on which the

                                       6
<PAGE>

            Investor Option Trigger has occurred (and, subject to the Investor's
            reasonable approval of the proceedings therefor, such Closing may
            take place concurrently with the occurrence of the Investor Option
            Trigger, provided, however, that the Investor's commitment to
            purchase Section 1.2(d) shares as set forth in an FGSB Election
            Notice shall be binding upon the Investor if, and only if, the
            Investor Option Trigger occurs no later than 10 Business Days
            following the FGSB Target Closing Date. If the Investor Option
            Trigger does not occur within such time period, then the FGSB
            Closing Notice and the FGSB Election Notice shall each be of no
            further force or effect, and, upon again determining the date, if
            any, on which the Investor Option Trigger will likely occur, the
            Company shall be required to promptly deliver another FGSB Target
            Closing Notice, and the provisions of this Section 1.2(d) shall
            again apply. If the Company fails to timely deliver an FGSB Closing
            Notice, then the Investor shall be entitled to deliver an FGSB
            Election Notice at any time within 20 Business Days of the first
            date on which the Investor becomes aware of the fact that the
            Investor Option Trigger has occurred, and such FGSB Election Notice
            shall specify the number of Section 1.2(d) Shares that the Investor
            shall purchase pursuant to this Section 1.2(d)(i) and shall also
            specify the Closing Date on which such purchase shall take place,
            which shall not be less than five nor more than 15 Business Days
            following the date of such notice.

      (ii)  On June 30, 2005 the Investor shall have the option to purchase up
            to 1,986,097 Section 1.2(d) Shares for $10.07 per share, if any
            Section 1.2(d) shares remain unsold as of such date. In the event
            that, prior to June 14, 2005, all Section 1.2(d) Shares have not
            been sold to the Investor and Section 1.2(d) Closing Notices have
            not been delivered to the Investor with respect to all Section
            1.2(d) Shares then remaining unsold, then (a) the Company shall
            deliver a written notice (the "Section 1.2(d)(ii) Option Notice") to
            the Investor not later than June 15, 2005 stating that the Investor
            has a purchase option pursuant to this Section 1.2(d)(ii) and
            specifying the number of Section 1.2(d)(ii) Shares covered by such
            option, and (b) the Investor may exercise its option to purchase up
            to such number of unsold Section 1.2(d) shares by delivering to the
            Company at any time prior to June 21, 2005 an irrevocable written
            notice specifying the number of previously unsold Section 1.2(d)
            Shares that the Investor shall purchase, and stating that such
            purchase shall take place at a Closing on June 30, 2005. If the
            Company fails to timely deliver the Section 1.2(d)(ii) Option
            Notice, then the notice date and Closing Date referred to in clause
            (b) of the immediately preceding sentence shall each be extended by
            a number of Business Days equal to the number of Business Days that
            the Company was deficient in delivering the Section 1.2(d)(ii)
            Option Notice.

            (e) If the Investor Option Trigger does not occur on or prior to
March 31, 2005, but the Company determines at any time thereafter with
reasonable certainty that the Investor Option Trigger will likely occur on a
date prior to December 31, 2005, then the Company shall promptly send to the
Investor a notice stating such fact, and specifying the date on which the
Investor Option Trigger is expected to occur (which date may not be less than 10

                                       7
<PAGE>

Business Days following the date of such notice). Not later than ten Business
Days following its receipt of such notice, the Investor may, in its sole
discretion, elect (by delivering an irrevocable written notice to the Company)
to have the provisions of Section 1.2(d) hereof apply to the Investor and the
Company, despite the failure of the Investor Option Trigger to occur prior to
March 31, 2005 (an "Extension Election"). If the Company fails to give such
notice under this Section 1.2(e), then the Investor shall be entitled to deliver
an Extension Election at any time within ten Business Days of the first date on
which the Investor becomes aware of the fact that the Investor Option Trigger
will likely occur after March 31, 2005 and prior to December 31, 2005. In the
event that the Investor makes an Extension Election, then the provisions of
Section 1.2(d) hereof shall apply upon the occurrence of the Investor Option
Trigger except that all calendar dates referenced in Section 1.2(d) shall be
extended by a number of Business Days equal to the number of Business Days
between (x) March 31, 2005 and (y) the date on which the Investor Option Trigger
occurs.

            (f) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, the
number of Section 1.2(d) shares shall be reduced by the number of "Higher Price
Participation Securities" (with such number calculated in terms of common-stock
equivalent shares), if any, that the Investor purchases pursuant to Section 6.7
hereof. "Higher Price Participation Securities" shall mean any Participation
Securities as to which the Investor's net purchase price (or in the case of
convertible securities, the Investor's effective conversion price, or, in the
case of exchangeable securities, the Investor's effective exchange price)
exceeds the Conversion Price then in effect for the Series B-1 Shares.

stockholders, customers or suppliers of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
on the other hand, that is required by the Exchange Act to be described in the
Exchange Act Reports and that is not so described and set forth on Schedule 2.37
attached hereto. No such relationship exists that will be required to be
described in the Company's proxy statement to be filed with the Commission in
connection with the Company's next annual meeting of shareholders that is not

such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Company Act").

                  2.39 REIT STATUS

            Commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2003, the
Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for
qualification as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") under the Code, and
the current and proposed method of operation of the Company and the Subsidiaries
described in the Exchange Act Reports will enable the Company to meet the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and the
Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes and not as a corporation or association taxable as a corporation; the
Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for all subsequent years, and
the Company does not know of any event that could reasonably be expected to
cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT at any time; Remington Lodging
and Hospitality, L.P. is an "eligible independent contractor" within the meaning

                  2.42 SOLVENCY

            Based on the financial condition of the Company as of the applicable
Closing Date, both prior to and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to occur on such Closing Date, (i) the Company's
fair saleable value of its assets exceeds the amount that will be required to be
paid on or in respect of the Company's existing debts and other liabilities
(including known contingent liabilities) as they mature; (ii) the Company's
assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its business for
the current fiscal year as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted
including its capital needs taking into account the particular capital
requirements of the business conducted by the Company, and projected capital
requirements and capital availability thereof; and (iii) the current cash flow
of the Company, together with the proceeds the Company would receive, were it to
liquidate all of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of
the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debt
when such amounts are required to be paid. The Company does not intend to incur
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature (taking into account
the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its debt).

            (b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Investor and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Investor
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other laws of general
application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (ii) as
limited by laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive
relief, or other equitable remedies.

                  3.2 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS.

            The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Investor and the consummation by the Investor of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not (i) result in a violation of the Investor's constituent documents
or (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default under (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default), or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any
agreement, indenture or instrument to which the Investor is a party, or result
in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree
applicable to the Investor or by which any property or asset of the Investor is
bound or affected (except for such conflicts, defaults, terminations,
amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations as would not materially

<PAGE>

                  3.3 OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS.

            The Investor has received a copy of the Company's Charter and
understands the restrictions on transfer and ownership of the Company's capital
stock included therein related to the qualification by the Company as a real
estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Sections 856

body, authority or agency or any other third party is required in connection
with the Investor's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, their
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein or the Investor's purchase
and ownership of the Series B Preferred Stock, other than (i) such as have been
obtained, or will have been obtained at the Initial Closing Date or the relevant
Closing Date, as the case may be, and (ii) such approvals, authorizations,
consents or orders or filings, the absence of which could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on
the assets, business, operations, earnings, properties or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the Investor.

                  3.6 ACCREDITED INVESTOR.

            The Investor is an "Accredited Investor" as such term is defined in
Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act. The Investor represents and

matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its or his
investment in the Series B Preferred Stock.

                  3.7 ABSENCE OF MARKET.

            The Investor acknowledges that the Series B Preferred Stock lacks
liquidity as compared with other investments since there is not, and there is
not expected to be, any market therefor, and that the sale or transfer of the
Series B Preferred Stock must comply with applicable federal and state
securities laws, The Investor acknowledges that it must bear the economic risk
of its investment in the Series B Preferred Stock for an indefinite period of
time since none of the Series B Preferred Stock has been registered under the
Securities Act and therefore cannot be sold unless such Series B Preferred Stock
is subsequently registered pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit G or otherwise, or an exemption from
registration is available.

                  3.8 INVESTMENT PURPOSES.

            The Investor is acquiring the Series B Preferred Stock for
investment purposes only, for its own account, and not as nominee or agent for
any other person or entity, and not

                                       24
<PAGE>

with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Investor further acknowledges that
representatives of the Company have advised it that no state or federal agency
or instrumentality has made any finding or determination as to the investment in
the Series B Preferred Stock, nor has any state or federal agency or
instrumentality made any recommendation with respect to any purchase or
investment in the Series B Preferred Stock.

                  3.9 ACCESS AND INFORMATION.

            The Investor has had access to such financial and other information

            After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall timely file all

            So long as any Series B Preferred Stock remains issued and
outstanding, none of the Company, the Operating Partnership nor any other direct
or indirect subsidiary of the Company may directly or indirectly issue any
Preferred Security, incur any additional Indebtedness or purchase or lease any
interest in any real property (other than any additions, repairs or replacements
to any real property in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice but in no event in excess of five percent of the undepreciated book
value of any such real property prior to any such additions, repairs or
replacements), if immediately following such issuance, incurrence, purchase or
lease and after giving effect to such issuance, incurrence, purchase or lease
and the application of the net proceeds therefrom and after giving effect to any
and all other issuances, incurrences, purchases or leases that occurred during

including the date of

                                       28

of Proportionately Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Proportionately Consolidated
Fixed Charges for the four fiscal quarters immediately preceding such issuance,

the applicable four fiscal quarters) would be less than 1.25x to 1 and (ii) the
ratio of Proportionately Consolidated Total Debt to Proportionately Consolidated
Total Undepreciated Real Estate Assets would exceed 75.0%. Any breach of any
covenant set forth in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to continue until cured,

                  thereof determined in accordance with GAAP.

                  7.9 FINDER'S FEES.

            Each party represents that it neither is nor will be obligated for
any finders' fee or commission in connection with this transaction. The Investor
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any liability for any
commission or compensation in the nature of a finders' fee (and the costs and

the Investor or any of its officers, employees or representatives is

<PAGE>

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the limitations
provided herein. Because of the difficulty of estimating certain internal costs,
the parties have agreed to the payment by the Company to the Investor of such
internal and external costs, fees and expenses in an amount and in accordance
with the schedule set forth on Exhibit L attached hereto, and the Company shall
not be responsible for any of the Investor's costs, fees or expenses in excess
of, or in addition to, those set forth on Exhibit L. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce or
interpret the terms of this Agreement, any related agreement or the Series B

other relief to which such party may be entitled.

term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written
consent of the Company and the Investor. Any amendment or waiver effected in
accordance with this paragraph shall be binding upon each holder of any
securities purchased under this Agreement at the time outstanding (including
securities into which such securities are convertible), each future holder of
all such securities, and the Company. No course of action or dealing, renewal,
release or extension of any provision of this Agreement or any related
agreement, or single or partial exercise of any such provision, or delay,
failure or omission on the Investor's part in enforcing any such provision shall
affect the obligations of the Company or the Operating Partnership or operate as
a waiver of such provision or preclude any other or further exercise of such
provision. No waiver by the Investor of any one or more defaults by any the
Company or the Operating Partnership in the performance of any of the provisions
of this Agreement or any related agreement shall operate or be construed as a
waiver of any future default, whether of a like or different nature, and each
such waiver shall be limited solely to the express terms and provisions of such
waiver.

                  7.12 SEVERABILITY.

            Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
hereof, and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  7.13 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreement or
understanding, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, including without limitation the confidentiality agreement dated as
of April 27, 2004 between the Company and the Investor, and no party shall be
liable or bound to any other party in any manner by any warranties,

                  Upon receipt of a written request (a "Registration Request")
from Holders holding at least 10% of the aggregate of the number of Registrable
Shares then outstanding, which shall specify the number of Registrable Shares to
be registered and the intended method of

                                       3
<PAGE>

distribution, the Company shall (i) promptly give notice of the Registration
Request to all non-requesting Holders and (ii) prepare and file with the
Commission, within 30 days after its receipt of such Registration Request a
registration statement for the purpose of effecting a Registration of the sale
of all Registrable Shares by the requesting Holders and any other Holder who
requests to have his Registrable Shares included in such registration statement
within 10 days after receipt of notice by such Holder of the Registration
Request; provided however, that such Holders may make such a request only with
respect to $20,000,000 or more of issued and outstanding Registrable Shares (or
such lesser amount, if any, equal to the full amount of any unregistered
Registrable Securities issued and outstanding which are in an aggregate amount
of less than $20,000,000 following the last date on which a closing is possible
under the Purchase Agreement). Each such request shall specify the number of

registration statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable
(including, without limitation, the execution of an undertaking to file

continuously effective until the date on which all Registrable Shares covered by
such registration statement are no longer Registrable Shares.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the
right (the "Suspension Right") to defer such filing (or suspend sales under any
filed registration statement or defer the updating of any filed registration
statement and suspend sales thereunder) until the reason for such deferral or
suspension no longer exists, but in no event for a continuous period of more
than 30 days or an aggregate of more than 90 days in any twelve-month period, if
the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by an executive
officer or any director of the Company stating that, in the good faith judgment
of the Company, it would materially interfere with any material financing,
acquisition, corporation reorganization, merger, or other transaction involving
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or would otherwise be detrimental to the
Company and its shareholders to file such registration statement or amendment or
supplement thereto at such time (or continue sales under a filed registration
statement) and therefore the Company has elected to defer the filing of such
registration statement (or suspend sales under a filed registration statement).

            Section 3. Piggyback Registrations.

                  (a) Until the date on which all Registrable Shares are no
longer Registrable Shares, if the Company proposes to register any of its
securities under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to (i) a registration
statement filed pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, (ii) a
registration on Form S-4 or any successor form, (iii) an offering of securities
in connection with an employee benefit, share dividend, share ownership or
dividend reinvestment plan, (iv) any registration statement filed by the Company
relating to the offering of Common Stock for its own account as a result of the
exercise of the exchange rights set forth in Section 7.4 of the Partnership
Agreement (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), or (v) any registration
statement filed in connection with a demand registration other than pursuant to
Section 2 of this Agreement; provided, however, that the exceptions in clauses
(iv) and (v) shall not apply if underwritten offerings are proposed to be made
under such registration statements) and the registration form to be used may be
used for the registration of Registrable Shares, the Company will give prompt
written notice to all Holders of Registrable Shares of its intention to

                                       4
<PAGE>

effect such a registration (each a "Piggyback Notice") and, subject to
subparagraphs 3(b) and (c) below, the Company will include in such registration
all Registrable Shares with respect to which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein within ten business days after the date of
sending the Piggyback Notice (a "Piggyback Registration"), unless, if the
Piggyback Registration is an underwritten offering, the managing underwriters
advise the Company in writing that in their opinion, the inclusion of
Registrable Shares would materially adversely interfere with such offering,
materially adversely affect the Company's securities in the public markets, or
otherwise materially adversely affect the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Registration pursuant to Section 2 is then in effect, the
Company shall have no obligation to effect the registration of Registrable
Shares under this Section 3 unless the securities proposed to be registered by
the Company are to be disposed of in an underwritten public offering. Nothing
herein shall affect the right of the Company to withdraw any such registration
in its sole discretion.

                  (b) If a Piggyback Registration is a primary registration on
behalf of the Company and, if the Piggyback Registration is an underwritten
offering, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in
their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner within a
price range acceptable to the Company, the Company will include in such
registration (i) first, the securities the Company proposes to sell and (ii)
second, the Registrable Shares requested to be included in such Registration and
any other securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata
among the holders of Registrable Shares requesting such registration and the
holders of such other securities on the basis of the number of Shares requested
for inclusion in such registration by each such holder.

                  (c) If a Piggyback Registration is a secondary registration on
behalf of holders of the Company's securities other than the Holders of
Registrable Shares, and, if the Piggyback Registration is an underwritten
offering, the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their
opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such registration
exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering
within a price range acceptable to the Holders initially requesting such
registration, the Company will include in such registration the securities
requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration and
the Registrable Shares requested to be included in such registration, pro rata
among the holders of securities requesting such registration on the basis of the
number of Shares requested for inclusion in such registration by each such
holder.

            Section 4. Registration Procedures.

                  (a) The Company shall promptly notify the Holders and, if
requested by the Holders, confirm in writing, the occurrence of the following
events:

                        (i) when any registration statement relating to the
      Registrable Shares or post-effective amendment or supplement thereto has
      been filed with the Commission and has become effective;

                                       5
<PAGE>

                        (ii) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
      suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement relating to the
      Registrable Shares;

                        (iii) the suspension of an effective registration
      statement by the Company in accordance with the last paragraph of Section
      2(a) hereof;

                        (iv) the Company's receipt of any notification of the
      suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Shares covered by a
      registration statement for sale in any jurisdiction; and

                        (v) the existence of any event, fact or circumstance
      that results in a registration statement or prospectus relating to
      Registrable Shares or any document incorporated therein by reference
      containing an untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a
      material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
      statements therein not misleading.

            The Company agrees to use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal
of any order suspending the effectiveness of any such registration statement or
any state qualification as promptly as possible. The Company also agrees to
prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to such
registration statement as may be necessary and to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Shares
covered by such registration statement in accordance with the Holders' intended
method of disposition set forth in the registration statement for such period.
The Investor agrees by acquisition of the Registrable Shares that upon receipt
of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the type
described in Section 4(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) to immediately discontinue its
disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to any registration statement
relating to such securities until the Investor's receipt of written notice from
the Company that such disposition may be made and, in the case of clauses (iii)
and (v) of Section 4(a), copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus. At
the written request of the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company (at
the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, in such
Holder's possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at
the time of receipt of such notice.

                  (b) The Company shall provide to the Holders, prior to the
filing thereof with the Commission, copies of the registration statement
relating to the Registrable Securities and any amendments or supplements
thereto, which documents shall be subject to the approval of the Holders only
with respect to any statements which relate to the Holders or their intended
method of disposition.

                  (c) The Company shall provide to the Holders, at no cost to
the Holders, a copy of the registration statement and any amendment thereto used
to effect the Registration of the Registrable Shares, each prospectus contained
in such registration statement or post-effective amendment and any amendment or
supplement thereto and such other documents as the requesting Holders may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Shares covered by such registration statement. The Company consents to the use
of each such prospectus and any supplement thereto by the Holders in connection
with the

                                       6
<PAGE>

offering and sale of the Registrable Shares covered by such registration
statement or any amendment thereto. The Company shall also file a sufficient
number of copies of the prospectus and any post-effective amendment or
supplement thereto with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (or, if the Common
Stock is no longer listed thereon, with such other securities exchange or market
on which the Common Stock is then listed) so as to enable the Holders to have
the benefits of the prospectus delivery provisions of Rule 153 under the
Securities Act.

                  (d) The Company agrees to use its best efforts to cause the
Registrable Shares covered by a registration statement to be registered with or
approved by such state securities authorities as may be necessary to enable the
Holders to consummate the disposition of such shares pursuant to the plan of
distribution set forth in the registration statement; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be obligated to take any action to effect any such
Registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this Section 4 in any
particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to (i) qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify but for this clause (d), (ii) subject itself to taxation in
any such jurisdiction or (iii) execute a general consent to service of process
in effecting such Registration, qualification or compliance unless the Company
is already subject to service in such jurisdiction.

                  (e) Subject to the Company's Suspension Right, if any event,
fact or circumstance requiring an amendment to a registration statement relating
to the Registrable Shares or supplement to a prospectus relating to the
Registrable Shares shall exist, immediately upon becoming aware thereof the
Company agrees to notify the Holders and prepare and furnish to the Holders a
post-effective amendment to the registration statement or supplement to the
prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other
required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
Registrable Shares, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

                  (f) The Company agrees to use its best efforts (including the
payment of any listing fees) to obtain the listing of all Registrable Shares
covered by the registration statement on each securities exchange on which
securities of the same class or series are then listed and to provide a transfer
agent and registrar for all Registrable Shares.

                  (g) The Company agrees to use its best efforts to comply with
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the end of any fiscal year during which a registration statement
effecting a Registration of the Registrable Shares shall have been effective, to
make available to its security holders an earnings statement satisfying the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.

                  (h) The Company agrees to cooperate with the selling Holders
to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
Registrable Shares to be sold pursuant to a Registration and not bearing any
Securities Act legend; and enable certificates for such Registrable Shares to be
issued for such numbers of shares and registered in such names as the Holders
may reasonably request at least two business days prior to any sale of
Registrable Shares.

                                       7
<PAGE>

                  (i) In the case of an underwritten Piggyback Registration, the
Company will have the right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to
administer the offering, and no Person may participate in any such underwritten
registration unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's securities on
the basis provided in any underwriting agreements approved by the Persons
entitled to approve such arrangements (including, without limitation, agreeing
not to effect any sale or distribution of the issue being registered or a
similar security of the Company, or any security convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, if and to the extent requested
in writing by the managing underwriter or underwriters, as the case may be,
provided that the terms of such request is no more onerous to such Person than
to any other Person selling under such Registration) and (b) completes and
executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms
of such underwriting agreements. If requested by the underwriters for any
underwritten offerings by Holders, under a registration requested pursuant to
Section 2(a), the Company will enter into a customary underwriting agreement
with such underwriters for such offering, to contain such representations and
warranties by the Company and such other terms as are customarily contained in
agreements of that type. The Holders shall be a party to such underwriting
agreement and may, at their option, require that any or all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting
agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of Holders. The Holders
shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreement
with the Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding the Holders and the Holders' intended method of
distribution and any other representation or warranties required by law.

                  (j) In an underwritten public offering, the Company shall
furnish on the date that Registrable Shares are delivered to the underwriters
for sale pursuant to such registration: (a) an opinion in form satisfactory to
the Holders and (b) a "cold comfort" letter of the type normally given in
underwritten offerings.

                  (k) The Company shall give the Holders of Registrable Shares
on whose behalf such Registrable Shares are to be so registered and their
underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and accountants, such access
to its books and records and such opportunities to discuss the business of the
Company with its officers and the independent public accountants who have
certified its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such
Holders and such underwriters or their respective counsel, to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act. Records which
the Company determines in good faith, to be confidential and which it notifies
the Holders are confidential shall not be disclosed by the Holders unless (i)
the disclosure of such records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement
or omission in a registration statement or (ii) the release of such records is
ordered pursuant to a subpeona or other order from a court of competent
jurisdiction. Each Holder of such Registrable Securities agrees that information
obtained by it as a result of such inspections shall be deemed confidential and
shall not be used by it as the basis for any market transactions in securities
of the Company unless and until such is made generally available to the public.
Each Holder of such Registrable Securities further agrees that it will, upon
learning that disclosure of such records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, give notice to the Company and allow the Company, at the Company's
expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the records
deemed confidential.

                                       8
<PAGE>

                  (l) Each Holder acknowledges that by asserting or
participating in its registration rights pursuant to this Agreement, such Person
may become a Selling Holder and thereby will be deemed a party to this Agreement
and will be bound by each of its terms.

            Section 5. Expenses of Registration. The Company shall pay all
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the registration,
qualification or compliance pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof. All Selling
Expenses incurred in connection with the sale of Registrable Shares by any of
the Holders shall be borne by the Holder selling such Registrable Shares. Each
Holder shall pay the expenses of its own counsel.

            Section 6. Indemnification.

                  (a) The Company will indemnify each Holder, each Holder's
officers and directors, and each person controlling such Holder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all expenses, claims,
losses, damages and liabilities (including reasonable legal expenses), arising
out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to
the Registrable Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or based on any
omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
the Company shall reimburse such Holder and each Holder's officers and
directors, and each person controlling such Holder within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred
by them in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss,
damage or liability, provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or
expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder or underwriter
for inclusion therein; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any such registration statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein
or any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in
which they were made not misleading in a prospectus or prospectus supplement, if
(i) such untrue statement or omission is completely corrected in an amendment or
supplement to such prospectus or prospectus supplement, the seller of the
Registrable Shares has an obligation under the Securities Act to deliver a
prospectus or prospectus supplement in connection with such sale of Registrable
Shares and the seller of Registrable Shares thereafter fails to deliver such
prospectus or prospectus supplement as so amended or supplemented prior to or
concurrently with the sale of Registrable Shares to the person asserting such
loss, claim, damage or liability after the Company has furnished such seller
with a sufficient number of copies of the same or (ii) if the seller received
written notice from the Company of the existence of such an untrue statement or
such an omission and the seller continued to dispose of Registrable Shares
following receipt of such written notice but prior to the time of the receipt of
either (a) an amended or supplemented prospectus or prospectus supplement that
completely corrected the untrue statement or the omission or (b) a notice from
the Company that the use of the existing prospectus or prospectus supplement may
be resumed.

                                       9
<PAGE>

                  (b) Each Holder will indemnify the Company, each of its
directors and each of its officers who signs the registration statement, each
underwriter, if any, of the Company's securities covered by such registration
statement, and each person who controls the Company or such underwriter within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all claims, losses,
damages and liabilities (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising
out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any such registration statement or prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or based on any omission (or alleged omission)
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only
to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or
omission (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement or
prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Company by such Holder for inclusion therein.

                  (c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section
6 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, but the
omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 6 except to the extent of the actual damages suffered by such
delay in notification. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such
action, including the employment of counsel to be chosen by the Indemnifying
Party (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party),
and payment of expenses. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
its own counsel in any such case, but the legal fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, unless the employment
of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party
in connection with the defense of such action, or the Indemnifying Party shall
not have employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action or the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses
available to it or them which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne
by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such
claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party,
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff
to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such
claim or litigation.

                  (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is
unavailable to a party that would have been an Indemnified Party under this
Section 6 in respect of any expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities
referred to herein, then each party that would have been an Indemnifying Party
hereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one
hand and such Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the statement or
omission which resulted in such expenses, claims, losses, damages and
liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue

                                       10
<PAGE>

statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or such
Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation or
by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this Section 6(d).

                  (e) No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

                  (f) In no event shall any Holder be liable for any expenses,
claims, losses, damages or liabilities pursuant to this Section 6 in excess of
the net proceeds to such Holder of any Registrable Shares sold by such Holder.

            Section 7. Information to be Furnished by Holders. Each Holder shall
furnish to the Company such information as the Company may reasonably request
and as shall be required in connection with the Registration and related
proceedings referred to in Section 2 or Section 3 hereof. If any Holder fails to
provide the Company with such information within 10 days of receipt of the
Company's written request, the Company's obligations under Section 2 or Section
3 hereof, as applicable, with respect to such Holder or the Registrable Shares
owned by such Holder shall be suspended until such Holder provides such
information.

            Section 8. Undertaking to Participate in Underwriting. If the
Holders of Registrable Shares shall propose to sell Registrable Shares in an
underwritten public offering, the Company shall make available members of the
management of the Company and its affiliates for reasonable assistance in
selling efforts relating to such offering, to the extent customary for a public
offering (including, without limitation, to the extent customary, senior
management attendance at due diligence meetings with the underwriters and their
counsel and road shows) and shall enter into underwriting agreements containing
usual and customary terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Company
for such types of offerings.

            Section 9. Rule 144 Sales.

                  (a) The Company covenants that it will file the reports
required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, so as to enable any
Holder to sell Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act
or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

                  (b) In connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition
by any Holder of any Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, the Company shall cooperate with such Holder to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Shares
to be sold and not bearing any Securities Act legend, and enable certificates
for such Registrable Shares to be for such number of shares and registered in
such names as the selling Holder may reasonably request at least two business
days prior to any sale of Registrable Shares.

            Section 10. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to the
choice of law principles of such State. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the
city of Chicago for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection
herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or
proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and
consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by
mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address for such notices to it under
this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.
EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO
REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

                  (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the full and
entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the
subject matter hereof.

                  (c) Amendment; Waiver. No supplement, modification, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
party to be bound thereby. No course of action or dealing, renewal, release or
extension of any provision of this Agreement or any related agreement, or single
or partial exercise of any such provision, or delay, failure or omission on a
Holder's part in enforcing any such provision shall affect the obligations of
the Company or operate as a waiver of such provision or preclude any other or
further exercise of such provision. No waiver by a Holder of any one or more
defaults by the Company in the performance of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or any related agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver of
any future default, whether of a like or different nature, and each such waiver
shall be limited solely to the express terms and provisions of such waiver.

                  (d) Notices, etc. Each notice, demand, request, request for
approval, consent, approval, disapproval, designation or other communication
(each of the foregoing being referred to herein as a notice) required or desired
to be given or made under this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be
deemed effectively given (a) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified,
(b) on the third business day after deposit with the United States Post Office,
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, (c) on the next business day
after dispatch via the overnight services of a nationally recognized overnight
courier or (d) upon confirmation of transmission by facsimile, all addressed to
the party to be notified at the address indicated for such party below, or at
such other address as such party may designate by ten (10) business days'
advance written notice to the other parties. Any notice or other communication
required to be given hereunder to a Holder in connection with a registration may
instead be given to the

                                       12

a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  (g) Section Titles. Section titles are for descriptive
purposes only and shall not control or alter the meaning of this Agreement as
set forth in the text.

                  (h) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding

otherwise available under applicable law or in equity, including without
limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief. Except as expressly
provided herein, nothing herein shall be considered an election of remedies.

                  (j) Attorneys' Fees. If the Company or any Holder brings an
action to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party in the
action shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with such action,
including any appeal of such action.

                  (k) Rules of Construction. The following rules shall apply to

      sections, subsections, clauses or exhibits are references to articles,
      sections, subsections, clauses or exhibits of this Agreement.

            (iii) The headings contained in this Agreement are solely for

      individually and, therefore, shall have no personal or individual
      liability of any kind in connection with this Agreement or the
      transactions contemplated hereby.
