<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">DALLAS &#151; (December&nbsp;27, 2004) &#151; Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) announced the signing of
a definitive agreement to acquire for $250&nbsp;million, a 21-property, 4,094-room hotel portfolio from
entities controlled by affiliates of the Fisher Brothers, the Gordon Getty Trust, and George Soros
collectively as majority partners, and certain members of Ashford&#146;s senior management team as
minority partners. The Company also announced the execution of a purchase agreement for the
closing of a private placement of up to $75&nbsp;million in cumulative convertible preferred stock with
Security Capital Preferred Growth Incorporated.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors of Ashford Hospitality Trust formed a Special Committee solely comprised of
independent directors to evaluate this transaction. The Special Committee was authorized to retain
independent advisors and to review, evaluate, negotiate, and approve the transaction. The Special
Committee retained independent advisors Hogan and Hartson L.L.P. as legal advisors, and Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. as financial advisors. The Special Committee unanimously approved the
acquisition. Morgan Stanley served as the exclusive financial advisor to the Fisher, Getty, and
Soros entities.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AHT to Acquire 21-Hotel Portfolio<BR>
Page 2<BR>
December&nbsp;27, 2004

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition total consideration of $250&nbsp;million is comprised of $35.0&nbsp;million in cash, the
issuance of $50.3&nbsp;million in operating partnership units, and the assumption of $164.7&nbsp;million in
debt. The purchase price equates to an 8.9x trailing twelve-month EBITDA multiple, an EBITDA yield
of 11.2% and a trailing twelve-month net operating income capitalization rate of 9.3% on the entire
21-hotel portfolio based on a trailing 12-month NOI of $23.3&nbsp;million. The average cost of the debt
is 7.4%, which may be reduced to 7.1% following the expected repayment of approximately a $14.7
million mezzanine loan. The acquisition is expected to close by February&nbsp;2005. The operating
partnership units were priced at $10.07 using the 20-day average closing price calculated 5
business days prior to the signing of the documents. Ashford management, comprising approximately
22% of the selling entity, structured approximately 100% of their net consideration in the form of
operating partnership units. The Fisher, Getty, and Soros entities, comprising approximately 78% of
the ownership interests in the selling entity, structured approximately 50% of their consideration
in cash and 50% in operating partnership units.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The core portfolio consists of 13 hotels across 5 brands and one independent comprising 3,099 total
rooms: Houston Embassy Suites Galleria in Houston, TX; Houston Hilton NASA/Clearlake in Houston,
TX; Fort Worth Radisson in Fort Worth, TX; St. Petersburg Hilton in St. Petersburg, FL; West Palm
Beach Embassy Suites and Admiralty Office Building in West Palm Beach, FL; Key West Crowne Plaza
LaConcha in Key West, FL; Sheraton Minneapolis West in Minnetonka, MN; Beverly Hills Crowne Plaza
in Los Angeles, CA; Rockland Radisson Hotel Boston/South Shore in Rockland, MA; Milford Radisson in
Milford, MA; Indianapolis Airport Radisson Hotel in Indianapolis, IN; Indianapolis Radisson Hotel
City Centre in Indianapolis, IN; and the Historic Inns in Annapolis, MD. Remington Lodging &#038;
Hospitality, an affiliate of the current manager of the properties, will operate the hotels.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The estimated $35-$40&nbsp;million budgeted capital improvement plan that commenced earlier in 2004 for
these properties remains underway, and will be completed under Ashford&#146;s ownership by early 2006.
The scope and completion dates vary by property, but should largely be completed by the first
quarter 2006.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ashford is evaluating strategic alternatives for eight smaller hotels that contribute a relatively
small portion of NOI to the portfolio. The trailing 12-month NOI contribution of $800,000 equates
to less than 3.5% of the total portfolio&#146;s NOI. The strategic alternatives for these smaller
assets include a potential sale, repositioning, and re-branding. These hotels include: Coral
Gables Holiday Inn in Coral Gables, FL; Warner Robins Ramada Inn in Warner Robins, GA; Yarmouth
Gull Wing Suites in South Yarmouth, MA; Hyannis Ramada Inn Regency in Hyannis, MA; Falmouth Inn on
the Square in Falmouth, MA; Commack Howard Johnson in Commack, NY; Westbury Howard Johnson in
Jericho, NY; and Dallas Best Western in Dallas, TX.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Monty J. Bennett, President and CEO of Ashford Hospitality Trust, said, &#147;This acquisition is a
significant achievement and has numerous advantages. Once again, we&#146;ve demonstrated our ability to
source investment opportunities at attractive yields and per key values as we have done
consistently throughout this past year. This transaction substantially increases our asset base
and market capitalization and reflects strong investor confidence in our business plan. Our
percentage of full-service, upper-upscale and upscale assets will increase thereby improving
Ashford&#146;s position for growth going forward, while providing additional brand and geographic

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">diversification. The majority of the assumed debt will be fixed-rate, increasing our ratio of
fixed to floating rate debt with only a minimal increase to our overall cost of debt. This
transaction also increases management&#146;s ownership interest in Ashford.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;The ability to complete this transaction with the issuance of such a large percentage of OP units
to high caliber, sophisticated real estate investment entities controlled by the Fisher Brothers,
the Gordon Getty Trust, and George Soros is a further testament to the investment interest in
Ashford&#146;s business strategy.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are pleased with the opportunity to convert a large portion of our ownership in this high
quality portfolio to an equity interest in Ashford&#146;s more diversified lodging platform,&#148; stated
Richard L. Fisher, the seller&#146;s managing general partner. &#147;We&#146;ve had a long, successful
relationship with this management team and have high confidence in their ability to create value
for shareholders throughout lodging cycles.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The private placement of Series&nbsp;B cumulative convertible preferred stock to Security Capital
Preferred Growth is a two-stage transaction for up to $75&nbsp;million in proceeds. The liquidation
preference is set at $10.07 per share, which is the same as the operating partnership unit pricing
for the 21-property hotel acquisition. The conversion ratio is at 1:1 with a three-year call
option, or a two-year &#147;soft call&#148; subject to achieving performance thresholds. The preferred
dividend is set at the greater of $0.14 per share per quarter or the prevailing quarterly common
stock dividend.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The first tranche is for $20&nbsp;million, with an initial $10&nbsp;million to be funded prior to December
31, 2004, and the remainder available for disbursement by June&nbsp;30, 2005. The second tranche is for
$55&nbsp;million and its availability is contingent upon the closing of the announced<BR>
21-property acquisition, provided the closing occurs prior to March&nbsp;31, 2005. Initially, $14.7
million will be funded at Security Capital&#146;s election at the closing of the acquisition, with
another $20&nbsp;million by June&nbsp;30, 2005, and the remainder available for disbursement by December&nbsp;23,
2005. Proceeds from the issuance may be used specifically for this 21-property acquisition or
drawn over time for new acquisitions or debt repayment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Bennett added, &#147;The importance of this transaction with Security Capital cannot be
underestimated. We have been able to secure an attractive and very cost effective source of
capital that provides significant flexibility for funding our acquisition of this 21-hotel
portfolio as well as future investment opportunities over the next year. This structure enables
Ashford to access funds on an as-needed basis concurrent with transaction closings and removes
capital market risk for this 21-property acquisition by locking in capital in advance. We are
pleased with the low cost of this transaction and most importantly the funding options it affords
Ashford over time. In addition, Security Capital has established a long track record of successful
real estate investing, particularly with publicly traded REITs, and we are very pleased to have
them as a long-term shareholder.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are delighted to become a significant equity investor in Ashford,&#148; said Anthony R.
Manno, Jr., CEO of Security Capital Research &#038; Management Incorporated, the investment advisor to
Security Capital Preferred Growth. &#147;Since 1997, Security Capital Preferred Growth has been a
leading provider of growth capital to dynamic real estate companies. Ashford&#146;s outstanding
