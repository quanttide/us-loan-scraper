<p>Section 2 - Financial Information </p>
</b></u><b>
<p>Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 15, 2004, Minrad
International, Inc., formerly named Technology Acquisition Corporation (the
&quot;Registrant&quot;), completed the acquisition of Minrad Inc., a Delaware corporation
(&quot;Minrad&quot;). The acquisition was effected through a reverse triangular merger in
which Minrad merged with Technology Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc. (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;),
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant with no assets or liabilities that
was formed for the sole purpose of facilitating the merger. Minrad was the
surviving corporation in the merger with Merger Sub, and it became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Registrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Registrant effected the
acquisition of Minrad under the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Exchange dated
July 16, 2004, as amended August 24, 2004 (the &quot;Acquisition Agreement&quot;). The
Registrant filed a copy of the original Acquisition Agreement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 2.1 to a Form 8-K filed on July
15, 2004, and on August 30, 2004, it filed the amendment to the original
agreement with the SEC as Exhibit 99.1 to a Form 8-K.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the merger, the
Registrant issued 22,363,896 shares of its common stock to Minrad's shareholders
in conversion of all of the 22,363,896 shares of Minrad common stock outstanding
on the date of the merger. Also in connection with the merger, outstanding
common stock purchase warrants and stock options to purchase a total of
7,201,181 shares of Minrad's common stock were cancelled in exchange for
warrants and stock options to purchase the same number of shares of the
Registrant's common stock at the same exercise prices and otherwise on the same
terms as the Minrad stock options and warrants that were cancelled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business and assets of Minrad
and certain risk factors and other considerations relating to Minrad's business
and assets and the merger are described in this Form 8-K under &quot;Item 5.01
Changes in Control of Registrant.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as described in this Item,
no director, executive officer, associate of any director or executive officer,
or any other affiliate, has any material relationship, direct or indirect, by
security holdings, contract or otherwise, resulting from the merger, which is
not shared by all other stockholders of the Registrant pro rata, in accordance
with their stock ownership. </p>
<b>
<p>Related Transactions and Parties</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 1, 2003, Minrad
entered into a an agreement (the &quot;Funding Agreement&quot;) with Cagan McAfee Capital
Partners, LLC (&quot;CMCP&quot;) under which CMCP agreed to assist Minrad in obtaining up
to $7.7 million in equity funding. Under the terms of the Funding Agreement,
Minrad agreed to compensate CMCP through; (1) payment of a management fee equal
to 2% of the equity funding raised by Minrad; (2) payment of an advisory fee
equal to 8% </p>
<p align="center">-2-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>of the amount of the equity funding where the equity funding is lead managed
by the Advisors, as defined below, directly or by a third party engaged by the
Advisors; (3) grant of incentive warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of
Minrad's common stock at $0.001 per share exercisable for a period of two years,
with the number of shares purchasable under the warrant to be proportionately
reduced to the extent that Minrad raised less than $7.7 million dollars in the
equity funding (the &quot;Incentive Warrants&quot;); and (4) grant of warrants to purchase
a number of shares of Minrad common stock equal to 10% of the number or shares
sold in the equity funding for which the advisory fee in (2) above, with the
warrants to be exercisable for a period of 7 years, have exercise prices
equivalent to the per share purchase prices in the equity funding, and to have a
cashless net exercise price provision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between December 1, 2003 and
July 15, 2004, Minrad sold an aggregate of 3,201,084 shares and raised gross
proceeds of $4.0 million, less expenses of $400,000, under the Funding Agreement through private placements
of its common stock at $1.25 per share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 20 and 21, 2004, the
Advisors and their affiliates together with John Liviakis and Liviakis Financial
Communications, Inc. acquired beneficial ownership of an aggregate of 4,283,750
shares or approximately 86% of the outstanding common stock of the Registrant.
The description of the terms of the those acquisitions are contained in Items 1
and 5 of the Registrants Form 8-K Report filed on May 27, 2004 and are
incorporated herein by reference. Immediately after those acquisitions, on May
21, 2004 the Registrant entered into an advisory agreement (the &quot;Advisory
Agreement&quot;) with CMCP and International Capital Advisory, Inc. (&quot;ICA&quot;) (CMCP and
ICA are hereafter collectively referred to as the &quot;Advisors&quot;), which provided
that the Advisors would provide the Registrant with advisory services in
connection with structuring and negotiating a potential acquisition transaction
involving the Registrant and a target operating company to be identified by the
Advisors with which the Registrant would be merged, or which the Registrant
would acquire, with the surviving entity to continue the business of the
Registrant. As consideration for their services, the Registrant paid the
Advisors 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 15, 2004, the Registrant
and Minrad entered into the Acquisition Agreement described above.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Section 3 - Securities and Trading Markets </p>
</u>
<p>Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As described in Item 2.01 of this
Current Report on Form 8-K, the Registrant issued to Minrad's shareholders on
December 15, 2004 in connection with its acquisition of Minrad's shares of the
Registrant's common stock in conversion of all of the 22,363,891 shares of
outstanding Minrad common stock on the date of the merger and issued stock
options and warrants to purchase a total of 4,842,931 shares of the Registrant's
common stock in exchange for the cancellation of all of Minrad's outstanding
warrants and stock options, with the warrants and options issued by the
Registrant having the same exercise prices and other terms as the</p>
<p align="center">-3-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>cancelled warrants and stock options to purchase Minrad common stock. All of
the issuances were made by the Registrant pursuant to an exemption from
registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
&quot;Securities Act&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between September 1, 2004 and
December 14, 2004, the Registrant effected a private placement of an aggregate
of 585,257 shares of its common stock (the &quot;Registrant Offering&quot;) for $1.75 per
share and raised gross proceeds of $1.0 million. The Registrant loaned the
proceeds of the Registrant Offering, less $151,700 of expenses, to Minrad
pursuant to a 6% Secured Grid Note. In connection with the Registrant Offering,
the parties agreed to pay to the Advisors management fees, advisory fees, and
warrants under the terms of the Funding Agreement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 15, 2004, pursuant to
the Funding Agreement, the Registrant entered into a Warrant Agreement with CMCP
and its affiliate Chadbourn Securities, Inc. under which it issued investment
warrants to ten persons to purchase 320,108 shares at $1.25 per share and to
three other persons to purchase 58,526 shares at $1.75 per share. The total
number of shares purchasable under the warrants is equal to 10% of the amount of
shares sold in each of the Minrad offering (described under Item 2.01 above) and
the Registrant's Offering. The warrants are exercisable for a seven year period,
until December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Registrant also entered into a
Stock Option Agreement with four of its shareholders on December 15, 2004. The
shareholders include principals of CMCP and Liviakis Financial Communications,
Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Option Agreement, the shareholders have
agreed to sell 1,403,792 of their shares to the Registrant at a price of $0.0001
per share if Chadbourn and its affiliates fail to complete the remaining
$2,161,840 of the $7.7 million equity funding, as required by the Funding
Agreement, by April&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2005. To the extent some, but not all, of the equity
funding is completed, the amount of option shares purchasable by the Registrant
reduces proportionately with the amount of the funding completed. To the extent
the options become exercisable on April&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2005, they will remain exercisable
for a two year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the issuances made in
connection with the Registrant Offering and the Minrad Offering discussed under
Item 2.01 were made by each party pursuant to an exemption from registration
under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act solely to accredited
investors as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.</p>
<p><u><b>Section 4 - Matters Related to Accountants and Financial Statements</b></u></p>
<p><b>Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the Merger, the Registrant
changed its certifying accountant auditor to Freed Maxick &amp; Battaglia, CPA's, PC
of Buffalo, New York.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Section 5 - Corporate Governance and Management </p>
</u>
<p>Item 5.01 Changes in Control of Registrant </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the merger
described in Section 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Registrant on
December 15, 2004 issued 22,900,000 shares of its common stock to the former
holders of all of Minrad's outstanding common stock and warrants and stock
options to purchase a total of 6,270,957 shares of the Registrant's common stock
to the former holders of all of the warrants and stock options to purchase
shares of Minrad's common stock. As a result, the former shareholders of Minrad
own approximately 82% of the Registrant's common stock </p>
<p align="center">-4-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>immediately following the merger. The remaining 18% of the Registrant's
shares of Common Stock will be held by its former shareholders, which include
CMCP. The merger was unanimously approved by Minrad's shareholders. Under Nevada
law, approval of the merger by the Registrant's shareholders was required and
such approval was received by the written consent of the holders of a majority
in interest of the outstanding common stock of the Registrant. An Information
Statement on Schedule 14C was filed with the Commission and delivered to the
former shareholders of the Registrant on September 30, 2004 in connection with
the required shareholder approval.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Operations of the Registrant Following the Merger </p>
<p>Minrad International, Inc.</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the merger, the Registrant assumed all of the assets, operations and
liabilities of Minrad, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant, and is
operating under its new name, Minrad International, Inc. The Registrant, through
Minrad, is now an acute care medical device and pharmaceutical company. The
Registrant is developing second-generation medical device products which
incorporate patented real time image-guidance technologies and enable medical
professionals to improve the accuracy of interventional procedures and provide a
significant reduction in radiation exposure for both patients and medical
professionals. Minrad's present pharmaceutical products are generic inhalation
anesthetics that are primarily used for surgical interventions. Minrad is
developing a drug/drug delivery system for conscious sedation. </p>
<b>
<p>Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad's primary pharmaceutical products are two inhalation anesthetics,
enflurane and isoflurane, which are manufactured in a state-of-the-art
manufacturing facility located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Dr. Ross Terrell,
Minrad's retired Vice President of Research, is the inventor of the majority of
inhalation anesthetics sold in the world today. Domestically, Minrad markets on
direct basis. Internationally, Minrad sells in either bulk or finished form to
its partners including Baxter International, Inc., Rx Elite, E. Merck Hoei Ltd.,
Novartis AG, and Laboratories PiSA. Enflurane and isoflurane are marketed for
human use under the trade names Compound 347(TM) and Terrell(TM). Isoflurane is
also marketed to veterinarians under the trade name Attane(TM). In 2005, Minrad
expects to introduce Sevoflurane, another generic inhalation anesthetic,
internationally and to file Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA
for its manufacture and marketing in the US.</p>
<b>
<p>Conscious Sedation</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad has under development a drug delivery system for the use of
halogenated ethers as inhalant analgesics. This initiative seeks to leverage
Minrad's two core businesses; medical devices and inhalation anesthetics. Minrad
has filed a patent application, &quot;Drug Delivery for Conscious Sedation&quot; (Burns,
McNeirney and Terrell), for a new system for administering conscious sedation
that would compete with the widespread use of nitrous oxide, sedative hypnotics,
and narcotic analgesics in both the pre-hospital and critical care hospital
markets. </p>
<b>
<p>Image Guidance</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad is developing medical devices that have broad applications in
orthopedics, neurosurgery, interventional radiology and anesthesia (pain
management). The platform medical device product is SabreSource(TM), Minrad's
second generation device (accuracy: plus or minus 1mm at 1 meter), which uses
unique x-ray and laser technology to enable medical professionals to precisely
visualize both the surface point of entry and the true angle of approach
required to reach an internal treatment area or biopsy site. SabreSource(TM), as
did the earlier product </p>
<p align="center">-12-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>DRTS(TM), significantly reduces radiation exposure to
both patients and operating room personnel. The SabreSource(TM) technology
significantly improves &quot;ease of use,&quot; provides a much larger targeting area, and
gives the surgeon complete control over target acquisition. Minrad's Light
Sabre(TM) product line is comprised of hand-held instruments that use the
inherent accuracy of a SabreSource(TM) laser to enable a medical professional to
guide the hand-held instrument from the point of incision to the targeted deep
tissue site (accuracy: plus or minus 3mm at 100 mm depth). Presently, Minrad's
Light Sabre(TM) line includes six disposable products, including: syringes,
aspirating needles, spinal needles, bone and core tissue biopsy needles and a
catheter introducer. </p>
<b>
<p>Intellectual Property</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad has been issued 13 U.S. patents, and eight of its U.S. patent
applications are pending. Minrad has developed 18 medical device products that
have received FDA 510(k) acceptance, and it has filed one additional 510(k)
application on product line accessories. Minrad's generic pharmaceutical
products have received two ANDA approvals and one ANADA approval (&quot;ANADA&quot; means
Abbreviated New animal Drug Applicaton). In addition, six of Minrad's products
have received Certificate of Entry (&quot;CE&quot;) clearance for sale in member countries
of the European Union.</p>
<b>
<p>Government Regulation</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients, specifically the
chemical synthesis of inhalation anesthetic compounds, and produces finished
pharmaceutical products using the compounds manufactured at its facility in
Bethlehem, PA. These manufacturing operations are regulated by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and performed in compliance with Current Good
Manufacturing Practices as set out by the FDA. The facility is registered with
the FDA as a pharmaceutical manufacturer and distributor. It is also registered
as a pharmaceutical distributor with the states of Pennsylvania, Texas, Idaho
and Kentucky. In addition, we believe that the operations at the Bethlehem, PA
facility are in compliance with the federal and state regulations regarding
environmental protection, occupational safety and health, labor law and state
and local fire safety, building codes, etc. and covenants of the industrial park
in which the facility is located. On average, the cost of environmental
compliance at our Bethlehem facility averages between 1.75% and 2.25% of revenue
generated by the facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad's facility at Buffalo, NY houses both the general headquarters
personnel, the medical device design and development technical staff and the
manufacturing operations associated with certain critical portions of its
medical devices. The facility also warehouses and distributes medical devices.
As such, the facility is registered with the FDA as a manufacturer and
distributor of medical devices. Certification of the facility under the En13485
Device Directive is scheduled for the end of March, 2005. Current activities at
this facility are not subject to any federal, state or local environmental
regulations.</p>

<p>MINRAD also has a number of product approvals in other countries and expects
additional approvals in the coming year.</p>
<p align="center">-14-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Risk Factors</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An investment in the Registrant's Common Stock is speculative and involves a
high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks in
connection with any investment in the Registrant's Common Stock. The risks and
uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company.
Additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely impair our business
operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer significantly.
In any of those cases, the value of the registrant's common stock could decline
significantly, and you may lose all of part of your investment.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Risks Related to Our Business</p>
<p>We Have Recently Been in Default Under Certain Obligations</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to cash flow constraints, recently Minrad has not been able to pay all of
its financial obligations as they become due, and we were in default for many
months. Minrad is in significant arrears to, and in default under, agreements
with certain service providers, other vendors and lenders including, but not
limited to, the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Regional Development Corp. (approximately<b>
</b>$213,000<b> </b>at December 15, 2004) and the Internal Revenue Service
(approximately<b> </b>$26,000<b> </b>at December 15, 2004). </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these defaults, claims have been asserted against Minrad from
time to time. Although we have generally been able to negotiate forbearance or
other arrangements with our creditors, until we are able to generate positive
cash flow on a consistent basis, the risk of claims by creditors will continue
and may interfere with our operations. </p>
<b>
<p>We May Not Reach Our Break-Even Sales Volume</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under our proposed development program, management estimates break-even sales
volume to be approximately $14 million. The break even sales volume will vary
based on the composition of customer sales location (domestic vs.
international), the mix between individually-packaged and bulk sales of our
inhalant anesthesia products, and the proportion of imaging products that are
leased rather than sold. Due to these unpredictable factors, our estimates
should only be used as a guideline as our break-even point could be higher. </p>
<b>
<p>We Have Historically Experienced Operating Losses And Expect to Continue to
Experience Losses in the Foreseeable Future</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad was incorporated on December 7, 1994, and began product
commercialization in February 2000. Since incorporation, we have incurred
substantial operating losses. Our company has generated relatively small amounts
of revenue in its image guidance product line. We do not expect to realize
positive cash flow for another twelve months, during which time we will be
susceptible to all the normal risks associated with growth stage companies,
including unforeseen delays and expenses.</p>
<p align="center">-15-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<b>
<p>We Are a Growth Stage Company</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, other than for our existing anesthesia and analgesia product
lines, we are at the stage of beginning product commercialization. Therefore,
our company is subject to all of the risks inherent in both the creation of a
new business and the development of new products, including the absence of a
history of significant operations. Our company's operations have been limited,
especially in the image guidance product line, and, as a result, we must
establish many functions that are necessary to conduct business. Such areas
include managerial and administrative structure, sales and marketing activities,
financial systems and personnel recruitment. We expect to require additional
funding as our company continues its product development activities and expands
its sales and marketing activities. </p>
<b>
<p>Our Financial Projections May Not be Reliable</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our projections, including our projected break-even point for sales, are
based on a number of estimates and assumptions which we believe to be reasonable
when taken as whole, but are inherently subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are
beyond our control and are based on specific assumptions with respect to future
business decisions and financings, some of which will change. In addition, our
limited operating history and sales data may prove to be insufficient to base
our projected revenue and expense assumptions. Projections are necessarily
speculative in nature, and it can be expected that one or more of these
assumptions will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results,
and such variances are likely to increase over time. Accordingly, actual results
achieved during the periods covered will vary from our financial projections,
and the variations may be material and adverse. </p>
<b>
<p>We Experience Long Sales Cycles</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience,
relatively long time periods between initial sales contacts and receipt of
formal purchase orders. In the image-guided product line, the cycle from first
contact to revenue generation involves making multiple visits to medical centers
to introduce our SabreSource(TM) platform product and Light Sabre(TM) products
to practitioners, and supporting actual clinical use of the system on an
evaluation basis. The entire sales cycle entails a substantial period of time,
on average between three and six months, and the lack of revenue experienced
during this cycle and the expenses involved in bringing new customers to the
point of revenue generation may put a substantial strain on our resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our anesthesia and analgesia
product line, the expansion of our international business into new markets
requires the registration of our products with each new country's respective
regulatory agencies. This registration process can take from 12 to 24 months to
complete. Growth in the domestic market depends on our ability to successfully
compete with established competitors in the pharmaceutical industry. We have
also initiated sales in the domestic veterinary market. However, this market
consists of roughly 35,000 relatively small-volume </p>
<p align="center">-16-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>customers, so conversion of a single account does not have an immediate
significant impact on revenue. </p>
<b>
<p>We May Face Delays in the Development of Our Technology </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our business strategy in the image-guided product line relies heavily upon
the sale of a family of patented disposable products (our Light Sabre(TM)
products). While FDA accepted, at this time only a portion of the tooling
necessary to manufacture these products has been fully developed. Bringing these
products to market involves the design and fabrication of sophisticated tooling
for plastic injection molding. Since tooling manufacture is inherently
expensive, the designs must be considered carefully in order to avoid costly
mistakes. Unforeseen difficulties in the development of these products, as well
as other medical device products, may lead to significant delays in the
production of tooling and the subsequent generation of revenue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our business strategy in the anesthesia and analgesia product line relies
heavily upon our ability to expand our product offerings in the anesthesia
market, most notably the launch of sevoflurane. All of our planned product
offerings require some form of regulatory acceptance in both the domestic and
international markets. Unforeseen difficulties in the development or regulatory
acceptance of these products may lead to significant delays in production and
the subsequent generation of revenue.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>
The development of our conscious sedation system is dependent upon our ability
to obtain adequate funding.&nbsp; The development of this system may be delayed
if adequate funding is not available.&nbsp; A lack of adequate financing would
delay our ability to recruit and retain competent technical staff to complete
the project and the further development, prototyping and testing of the device
to administer the drug component of the system in conformance with FDA
requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, unforeseen delays in regulatory
acceptance/approval could adversely impact the market introduction of the
system.</p>
<b>
<p>We Depend on Strategic Partnerships and Relationships</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our success depends largely upon our ability to create and maintain important
relationships with commercial partners, particularly in international
distribution. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or
maintain strategic partnerships. If we are unable to both maintain strategic
partnerships currently in place and develop additional strategic partnerships in
critical areas, such as international sales, our business may be adversely
affected.</p>
<b>
<p>We May Face Competition Which May Adversely Affect Our Business </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our imageguided product line, radiation exposure from fluoroscopy and the
need for accuracy in biopsying a sub-surface target under fluoroscopy are
well-recognized concerns. As a result, there is no guarantee that present
fluoroscope manufacturers, radiological suppliers, biopsy vendors, and suppliers
of minimally-invasive medical devices are not already engaged in research and
product development to address these concerns or will not become engaged in
these areas of research and product development. Competition can be expected to
increase as technological advances are made and commercial applications broaden.
Our company competes with other companies within the image-guided market, many
of which have more capital, more extensive research and development capabilities
and greater marketing and human resources than our company. Competitors may
develop new or enhanced products or processes that may be more effective, less
expensive, safer or more readily available than any products or processes </p>
<p align="center">-17-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>developed by us. There can be no assurance that our products or processes
will compete successfully, or that research and development by others will not
render our company's products or processes obsolete or uneconomical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in the anesthesia and analgesia product line, our company directly
competes with larger and more established companies that have more capital, more
extensive research and development capabilities and greater marketing and human
resources than our company. Competitors may develop new or enhanced products or
processes that may be more effective, less expensive, safer or more readily
available than any products or processes that we develop. In addition, the
regulatory requirements and processes associated with the introduction of
generic pharmaceuticals require considerably longer approval cycles than those
required in the medical device industry. There can be no assurance that our
products or processes will compete successfully or that research and development
by others will not render our products or processes obsolete or uneconomical.
</p>
<b>
<p>The Loss of Services of Existing Personnel Would Adversely Affect Our
Business. </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience
and efforts of our executive officers and senior management staff. The loss of
the services of existing personnel, particularly John McNeirney and Bill Burns,
prior to the completion of integral projects over the course of the next 12
months would be detrimental to our research and development programs and to our
overall business. Our company's anticipated growth and expansion into areas and
activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of key
personnel. We are currently seeking to hire several senior managers. Competition
for personnel at this level is intense and there can be no assurance that we
will be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel necessary for the
development of our business. See &quot;Management.&quot; </p>
<b>
<p>We Must Hire and Retain Skilled Technical and Managerial Personnel </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified personnel are in great demand among acute care companies. Our
success depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, motivate and
retain qualified management and highly-skilled employees, particularly
technical, sales, and marketing personnel, assembly technicians, and other
critical personnel. Any failure to attract and retain the highly-trained
technical personnel that are integral to direct sales, technology development
and technical support teams may limit the rate at which our company can generate
sales and develop new products or product enhancements. Similarly, the failure
to recruit key scientific and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be
detrimental to our research and development programs and to our overall
business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain
skilled persons and the loss of skilled technical personnel would adversely
affect our company. </p>
<b>
<p>Other Companies May Claim That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property or
Proprietary Rights </p>
</b>
<p align="center">-18-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our company has engaged legal counsel to conduct extensive patent searches to
determine if our products inadvertently violate third party intellectual
property rights. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that such rights are not
being violated. If any of our products are found to violate third party
intellectual property rights, we may be required to re-engineer one or more of
our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering
our products without substantial re-engineering, and such efforts may not be
successful.</p>
<b>
<p>Failure to Obtain Regulatory Approval for Our Products in the Future May
Adversely Affect Our Business. </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &quot;FDC
ACT&quot;), we must obtain clearance from the FDA prior to commercial use in the U.S.
of certain of the products that we may develop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical Devices. The production and marketing of our products and our ongoing
research and development activities are subject to regulation by numerous
governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Although our current
products only require 510 (k) acceptance, involving a lower level of FDA review,
it is possible that with future products we may be required to complete the
pre-market approval (&quot;PMA&quot;) process mandated by the FDA, and equivalent
approvals from foreign authorities, prior to marketing these products.
Currently, we must submit our products to a review process that generally takes
three months and may require the expenditure of substantial resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, sales of medical products outside the U.S. are subject to
foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The
time required to obtain approval for sale in each respective country may be
longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the U.S. In order to
sell our products inside European Union member countries, and an increasing
number of other countries, we will be required to obtain EN13485 certification.
There can be no assurance that this will occur as planned, or at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pharmaceutical Products. The production and marketing of our anesthesia
products are also subject to significant regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and
by numerous governmental authorities under the laws of other countries. Although
we have satisfied such regulations for our current products in the U.S. and the
other countries in which we currently market our products, we will need to
satisfy all governmental regulations before we can introduce any new
pharmaceutical products in the U.S. or extend the sale of our existing
anesthesia products to additional foreign countries. The time required for
obtaining any such additional regulatory approvals is uncertain, and there can
be no assurance that we will be able to obtain them in a timely manner, or at
all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cGMP Guidelines. Regulations
regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to change. We
cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have on our business,
financial condition or results of operation. Failure to comply with applicable </p>
<p align="center">-19-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>regulatory requirements could have material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the time required for obtaining regulatory approval is
uncertain. Delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in FDA
policy, including FDA policy relating to current Good Manufacturing Practices (&quot;cGMP&quot;)
standards, during periods of product development. Similar delays may also be
encountered in countries outside the U.S. There can be no assurance that
regulatory acceptance will be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The failure
to obtain timely regulatory acceptance of our products, any product marketing
limitations or a product withdrawal would have a material adverse effect on our
company. Regulatory acceptance, if granted, may include significant limitations
on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, to
obtain such approvals, the FDA and certain foreign regulatory authorities may
impose numerous other requirements with which medical device manufacturers must
comply. FDA enforcement policy strictly prohibits the marketing of approved
medical devices for unapproved uses. Product acceptance could be withdrawn for
failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen
problems following initial marketing. The third party manufacturers upon whom we
depend to manufacture our products are required to adhere to applicable FDA
regulations regarding cGMP standards and similar regulations in other countries,
which include testing, control and documentation requirements. Ongoing
compliance with cGMP regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements
will be monitored by periodic inspection by the FDA and by comparable agencies
in other countries. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements,
including marketing or promoting products for unapproved use, could result in,
among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall
or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of
the government to grant PMA for devices, withdrawal of acceptances and criminal
prosecution. Changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental
regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory acceptance of our
products. Certain material changes to medical devices also are subject to FDA
review and acceptance. Delays in receipt of or failure to obtain such
acceptances, the loss of previously obtained acceptances, or failure to comply
with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse
effect on our company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
</p>
<b>
<p>We Are Subject to Environmental Regulation </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our operations are subject to
Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things,
emissions to air, discharges to waters, and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation, treatment and disposal of raw materials, waste and other
materials. We believe that our business, operations and facilities have been,
and are being, operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including state and
local fire codes related to, among other things, flammable materials, many of
which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.
However, the operation of any inhalant pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and
the handling of specialty raw materials entail risks in these areas, and there
can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not </p>
<p align="center">-20-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>be incurred. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be
required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety
laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
To meet changing licensing and regulatory standards, we may be required to make
additional significant site or operational modifications, potentially involving
substantial expenditures or reduction or suspension of certain operations. There
can be no assurance that all environmental and health and safety matters
pertaining to our prior or ongoing activities have been identified or that the
scope of, or costs to remediate, such matters will not be material</p>
<b>
<p>We Rely Upon Third-Party Manufacturers </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our image-guided product line, we believe that our success will depend in
part on our ability to have third parties sub-assemble our products in
accordance with established quality and cost standards, in sufficient quantities
and in a timely manner. Although we remain responsible for manufacturing, there
can be no assurance that the third-party manufacturers will perform as expected.
Failure of third-party manufacturers to perform will adversely affect our
company's ability to manufacture and market its products and generate revenue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our anesthesia and analgesia product line, our company manufactures, and
will continue to manufacture, our product line of inhalation anesthetics at our
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania facility. Such manufacturing of pharmaceuticals is in
full accordance with established quality, safety and environmental regulations,
although unanticipated changes in safety and environmental regulations could
adversely affect the facility's ability to remain in continuous operation. The
continued manufacture of our pharmaceutical products is reliant on the continued
availability of certain specialty raw materials and inability to acquire these
when needed would adversely affect continued production. </p>
<b>
<p>We Face The Risk of Commercial Expansion </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect that we will be able to expand our business to address potential
growth in the number of customers, to expand our product offerings and to pursue
other market opportunities. In order to successfully implement our business
strategy, it will be necessary for us to expand our operations rapidly. Our
efforts to expand and accelerate our growth will require capital expenditures to
improve our operational, financial and inventory systems, procedures and
controls and will present new operational issues including management of an
increasing number of production, sales, marketing and customer support personnel
and the need to expand, train and manage our workforce, particularly our
pharmaceutical products workforce. These efforts may strain our management,
financial and other resources. In addition, we use internal estimates, based on
industry data, to identify the market size and opportunities available for our
products. We may have overestimated or underestimated the opportunities in the
markets for our products or we may be unsuccessful in managing our additional
capital expenditures and operational needs to optimize our growth and expansion.
If our efforts are unsuccessful or if we encounter any delay in the production
and commercialization of our products, these results would have an adverse
impact on our business and operating results. </p>

<b>
<p>Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Protect Our Proprietary Technology </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our success depends, to a significant degree, upon the protection of our
proprietary technologies. While we currently own or have an exclusive license to
exploit a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents that protect our
products, the need to pursue additional protections for our intellectual
property is likely as new products are developed and as existing products are
enhanced, and there is no guarantee that such protections will be attained in a
timely manner, or at all. The filing and maintenance fees and the legal and
other expenses necessary to obtain and maintain appropriate patent protection in
the United States and important foreign countries is not insignificant.
Insufficient funding may inhibit our ability to do so. Additionally, if we must
resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the
proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of
risk to our proprietary rights if we are unsuccessful in, or cannot afford to
pursue, such proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future patents may be issued to third parties upon which our company's
technology may infringe. We may incur substantial costs in defending ourselves
against claims under any such patents. Furthermore, parties making such claims
may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which effectively
could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our
products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial
damages against our company. In the event of a claim of infringement, we may be
required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, if
at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such license could have
a material adverse effect on our company. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also will rely on trade secrets and contract law to protect certain of our
proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that any such contract will
not be breached, or that if breached, we will have adequate remedies.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of our trade secrets will not
become known or independently discovered by third parties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&quot;PTO&quot;) adopted changes to the
U.S. patent law that changed the term of issued patents to 20 years from the
date of filing rather than 17 years from the date of issuance, subject to
certain transition periods. Beginning in June 1995, the patent term became 20
years from the earliest effective filing date of the underlying patent
application. Such change may reduce the effective term of protection for patents
that are pending for more than three years in the PTO. In addition, as of
January 1996, all inventors who work outside of the U.S. are able to establish a
date of invention on the same basis as those working in the U.S. Such change
could adversely affect our ability to prevail in a priority of invention dispute
with a third party located or doing work outside of the U.S. While we cannot
predict the effect that such changes will have on our business, such changes
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to protect our proprietary
information and sustain the commercial viability of our products. Furthermore,
the possibility of extensive delays in the patent process could effectively
further reduce the term during which a marketed product could be protected by
patents. See &quot;Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our products in the
future may adversely affect our business.&quot; </p>
<p align="center">-22-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we have entered into confidentiality and invention agreements with
our employees and consultants, there can be no assurance that such agreements
will be honored or that we will be able to protect our right to our unpatented
trade secrets and know-how effectively. Moreover, there can be no assurance that
others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and
know-how. In addition, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other
proprietary rights from third parties. There can be no assurance that any
licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights would be made
available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain required licenses,
we may encounter delays in product development or find that the development,
manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed.
Additionally, we may, from time to time, support and collaborate in research
conducted by universities and governmental research organizations. There can be
no assurance that we will have or be able to acquire exclusive rights to the
inventions or technical information derived from such collaborations, or that
disputes will not arise with respect to rights in derivative or related research
programs conducted by our company or collaborators.</p>

<p>We Face Uncertainties Regarding Health Care Reform </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several states and the United States government are investigating a variety
of alternatives to reform the health care delivery system and further reduce and
control health care spending. These reform efforts include proposals to limit
spending on health care items and services, limit coverage for new technology
and limit or control the price health care providers and drug and medical device
manufacturers may charge for their services and products, respectively. If
adopted and implemented, such reforms could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. See &quot;Business
Overview.&quot; </p>
<b>
<p>We May Face Potential Product Liability Claims in the Future </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In testing, manufacturing and marketing our products, we risk liability from
the failure of products to perform as expected. Although we have product
liability insurance, such insurance may be inadequate, become unobtainable or
become prohibitively expensive. Failure to obtain adequate insurance may
significantly impair our ability to test, manufacture and market our products.
</p>
<b>
<p>Business Interruption </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February 2003, we experienced a significant business interruption in our
Bethlehem facility due to storm damage. We filed a multi-million claim with our
insurance carrier, Chubb Insurance. To date we have received a progress payment
of $500,000. We have proposed a settlement of the balance of our claim to
facilitate receipt of additional funds, but there can be no assurances that we
will receive additional funds from Chubb or the timing of the receipt of such
funds, if any.</p>

<p>We May Incur Unforeseen Costs and We Will Need to Raise Additional Capital in
Order to Meet Our Business Plan </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minrad is currently operating at a loss, and we intend to increase our
operating expenses significantly as we expand our sales and marketing, and
continue our technology development efforts. Given the long sales cycle in our
image-guided product line from initial customer contact to actual revenue
generation, if any, no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate
sufficient, if any, additional revenue to fund operations beyond this period.
Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen costs that could also require us to
seek additional capital. We currently do not have any permanent arrangements or
credit facilities in place as a source of funds should this need arise, and
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient, if any,
additional capital, nor is there any assurance that we will be able to raise
such capital on acceptable terms. Any additional financing may result in
significant dilution to our company's existing shareholders.</p>
<b>
<p>Concentration of Stock Ownership and Control </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Merger, the ownership of our common stock will continue to be
highly concentrated. See &quot;Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management.&quot; As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will be able to
control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.
See &quot;Description of Capital Stock.&quot; This concentration of ownership may have the
effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control, and could
deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Shares
as part of a sale of our company and may affect the market price of our stock.
</p>
<b>
<p>Future Financings Cannot Be Guaranteed</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will need to raise approximately $9 million in additional capital in order
to meet our business plan during the next 12 months, and the required additional
financing may not be available. There can be no assurances that the company's
anticipated future financings will occur, or that such financings be available
on acceptable terms. </p>
<b>
<p>Potential and Actual Conflicts of Interest With Advisors </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain advisors who have advisory agreements with the Company and/or Minrad,
including Liviakis Financial Communications, Inc., International Capital
Advisory, Inc., and Cagan McAfee Capital Partners, Inc. (collectively, the
&quot;Advisors&quot;) are also major shareholders of the Company, in part because the
Company paid them in stock for their services. (See &quot;Related Parties and

<p>Future Sales of Large Amounts of Common Stock </p>
</b>
<p align="center">-24-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act of 1933 could adversely affect the market price of
our common stock. Certain of our affiliates, who beneficially own large amounts
of our Common Stock, are not under lockup letters or other forms of restriction
on the sale of their Common Stock. Sales of a large number of shares of Common
Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the Common
Stock and could materially impair our future ability to generate funds through
sales of Common Stock or other equity securities. </p>
<b>
<p>After the Completion of the Merger, Our Common Stock Will Continue to Be
&quot;Penny Stock&quot; </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our common stock is approved for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Since
our common stock trades below $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a
&quot;penny stock&quot; and is subject to SEC rules and regulations, which impose
limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a
penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the
associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such
securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited
investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a
purchaser and receive such purchaser's written agreement to a transaction prior
to sale. These regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of
our Common Stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our Common
Stock. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stockholders should be aware that, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in
recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our &quot;penny stock&quot; designation may adversely affect the development of any
public market for the Company's shares of Common Stock or, if such a market
develops, its continuation. Broker-dealers are required to personally determine
whether an investment in &quot;penny stock&quot; is suitable for customers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penny stocks are securities (i) with a price of less than five dollars per
share; (ii) that are not traded on a &quot;recognized&quot; national exchange; (iii) whose
prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system (NASDAQ-listed
stocks must still meet requirement (i) above); or (iv) of an issuer with net
tangible assets less than $2,000,000 (if the issuer has been in continuous
operation for at least three years) or $5,000,000 (if in continuous operation
for less than three years), or with average annual revenues of less than
$6,000,000 for the last three years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act,
and Rule 15g-2 of the Commission require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks
to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny
stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document </p>
<p align="center">-25-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account.
Potential investors in the Company's Common Stock are urged to obtain and read
such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be
&quot;penny stock.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 15g-9 of the Commission requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to
approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before
selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the
broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her
financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii)
reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny
stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient
knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of
penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement
setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in
(ii) above; and (iv) receive assigned and dated copy of the statement from the
investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor's financial
situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with
these requirements may make it more difficult for the Company's stockholders to
resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">BUSINESS OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Health Care Industry Trends </p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect the following <a NAME="_DV_C5">growth trends in the healthcare
industry to affect the market for our products.</a><a NAME="_DV_M3"></a><a NAME="_DV_M4"></a></p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased Cost-Containment Efforts. </i>Cost-containment efforts within the
healthcare industry support initiatives that lead to reduced severity of
surgical procedures and promote quicker recovery of patients, reducing follow-up
requirements and shortening the length of hospital stays.<a NAME="_DV_M5"></a></p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased Public Awareness in the Healthcare Industry. </i>Due to the
increase in public awareness and sensitivity in the healthcare industry to
women's health issues, there has been an increase in diagnostic procedures for
osteoporosis and breast cancer. For example, vertebroplasty is a diagnostic
procedure used to treat an osteoporotic fracture, which occur more frequently in
menopausal women. Based on industry data, we estimate that 40% of all women will
develop an osteoporotic fracture within their lifetime, and believe that 10% of
these fractures require open surgical intervention today. In the future, we
believe open surgical interventions will be replaced by vertebroplasties, a
procedure recently approved for reimbursement by numerous states.
<a NAME="_DV_M6"></a></p>
<p align="center">-26-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased Focus on Preventative Medicine. </i>Preventative medicine has been
proven to be cost and quality effective. A by-product of preventative medicine
combined with improved imaging technology is the increased detection of
deep-tissue lesions. Without improved biopsy accuracy, the risk of false
negatives increases dramatically for deep-tissue lesions. A false negative
occurs when a patient is informed that a particular biopsy is not malignant, but
in fact, the health care professional missed the target lesion. According to
research published by Alex Brown, as many as 15 to 20% of all breast biopsies
today generate false negatives. <a NAME="_DV_M7"></a></p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aging Population. </i>An increase in the population of people over the age of
50 in our key markets represents a key component of industry growth. As the
population ages, there is an increased demand for testing and surgical
procedures.<a NAME="_DV_M8"></a></p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong Inhalation Anesthetic Market Fundamentals</i>. Isoflurane continues to
be a major player in the inhalation anesthetic market. Enflurane has a strong
foreign niche market, particularly in areas with high birth rates, and is the
only modern inhalation anesthetic approved for use in labor and delivery. We are
one of two manufactures of enflurane in the world and are positioning ourselves
as the low-cost producer. Upon regulatory acceptance, we also have plans to
produce a third inhalant anesthetic product, sevoflurane.<a NAME="_DV_M9"></a></p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government Reimbursement. </i>Suppliers of health care products and services
in the U.S. are greatly affected by Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally,
suppliers in both the U.S. and international markets are greatly affected by
other government insurance programs, as well as by private insurance
reimbursement programs. Third-party payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private health
insurance, health administration authorities in foreign countries and other
organizations) may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products
by establishing the level of reimbursement provided to the hospitals and
patients for use of our products, or by taking the position that such
reimbursement is not available for any use. Where appropriate, we will endeavor
to obtain approval for third party-reimbursement for use of its products. See
&quot;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We face uncertainties regarding
health care reform.&quot;</p>

<p>Inhalation Anesthetics</p>

<p><a name="_DV_M26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>There are five halogenated inhalation anesthetics in
use in the world today: halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and

and patented by Ross Terrell, Ph.D., our retired VP Research. Terrell also held
a patent on the six compounds in the sevoflurane family.<a NAME="_DV_M28"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The market for inhalation anesthetics <a NAME="_DV_M29"></a>is presently<a NAME="_DV_M30"></a>
approximately $925 million worldwide and increasing at 8%-10% annually. The
principal factors in the general market growth are an increase in general
surgeries (1.8% in the United States, 3.5% in the<a NAME="_DV_M31"></a> rest of
the world), and the substitution of higher value agents for lower value<a NAME="_DV_M32"></a>
anesthetic agents, resulting in an appreciation in value per surgery. For
reference<a NAME="_DV_M33"></a>, the aver<a NAME="_DV_C31">age cost per
veterinary surgery for inhalation anesthetic agents </a><a NAME="_DV_M34"></a>
ranges from $0.50 to $1.00 and for human surgery from $1.00 to $50.00 depending
on the agent chosen and local pricing. In the human market<a NAME="_DV_M35"></a>
the overall average is slightly above $11 a procedure. (It should be noted that
even within the averages there are significant differences based on the length
of procedure, surgery site etc.). Overall, the relationship between agent cost
and procedure cost is such that there is less price sensitivity than certain
other pharmaceutical markets.</p>

enflurane and isoflurane. Enflurane is a niche product with principal
applications in labor and delivery and where myocardial depression and related
myocardial oxygen consumption is beneficial, such as coronary by-pass. It is the
only inhalation anesthetic<a NAME="_DV_M54"></a> agent approved for labor and
delivery and,<a NAME="_DV_M55"></a> as a result, its sales volume is
concentrated in countries with higher birth rates, most notably Latin America.
Management estimates the market for enflurane is to be $15 million a year in
2005. </p>
<p><a name="_DV_M56">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>Isoflurane is sold throughout the world. Present<a NAME="_DV_M57"></a>
worldwide sales are estimated by management to be $150+ million with $50 million
of that in the veterinary market<a NAME="_DV_M58"></a> in 2005, where it remains
standard of care for companion animals. In the human market, isoflurane has
acceptance across a wide range of surgeries and is of particular use in
neurosurgery as it has minimal impact on intracranial pressure and can be used
to induce hypotension and reduce bleeding. We sell isoflurane under the Terrell<a NAME="_DV_M60"></a><sup>TM</sup>

Celltech Medeva had paid $54 million six years earlier) in December 2000.
Although the Bethlehem plant contains state-of-the-art equipment, due to poor
management it was operated as the high cost producer in the industry and was
running substantially below capacity. Messrs. McNeirney and Burns used their
know-how in inhalation anesthetics along with their turnaround experience to
transform a business that was producing product at above selling prices at the

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhalation anesthetics are sold<a NAME="_DV_M89"></a> as 99.9% pure
compounds. There are no additives or excipients. They are naturally aseptic and
go through a phase change from liquid to vapor in their delivery. As such, the

<p>MR Tested Laryngoscope Blades &amp; Handles</p>

<p><a name="_DV_M128">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>To complement the pharmaceutical anesthesia offerings,
we have introduced a specialty product: MR tested laryngoscope blades and
handles. These products allow an anesthetist to intubate a patient very near
<a NAME="_DV_M129"></a>(within eighteen inches<a NAME="_DV_C109">)</a><a NAME="_DV_M130"></a>
of the<a NAME="_DV_C110"> MRI </a><a NAME="_DV_M131"></a>magnet without ferro-magnetic
or radio frequency interference. Many patients cannot remain still in a magnet
for 45 minutes. This is particularly true of children, certain adults that are
claustrophobic, and patients who need some pain relief due to their injuries. We
believe we have the <a NAME="_DV_M132"></a>only FDA acceptance for an MR
tested product in this area. We also have two patents (#6,036,639 and
#6,444,358)<a NAME="_DV_C112"> on these products.</a></p>

<p><a NAME="_DV_M134"></a>Conscious Sedation</p>
</b>
<p align="center">-31-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nitrous oxide and sedative hypnotics have been used
with varying degrees of success as analgesics <a NAME="_DV_M136"></a>for
centuries. In the past, inhalant anesthetics were not used as analgesics due to
<a NAME="_DV_M137"></a>the absence of equipment to accurately deliver the agents
and the fact that the manufacturers of inhalation agents also made and sold
anesthesia equipment costing $100,000 -200,000 per unit.<a NAME="_DV_M139"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhalation agent<a NAME="_DV_M140"></a>s, meet the key requirements for a
conscious sedation agent. They are proven safe and effective - at higher doses.
They reverse themselves through exhalation. They have a very rapid uptake to
analgesic levels (0.4 - 0.64 MAC). They are not addictive or DEA controlled
substances. MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) is the accepted method for
comparing the potency of anesthetic agents. It is the volumetric concentration
of anesthetic agent in the inspired gas stream necessary to achieve anesthesia.<a NAME="_DV_M143"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We filed an application for a US Patent (October, 2002), which covers the use
of inhalation anesthetics as inhalant analgesics. Modern inhalation agents move
through the initial sedation/analgesia phase rapidly. This compares to a much
longer period of transition with earlier agents. In fact, the sedation and
analgesia phase is often missed entirely if other induction agents or narcotic
analgesics are administered. We plan to produce a device that will &quot;freeze&quot; the
delivered concentration at an analgesic level and not allow additional agent to
be delivered.<a NAME="_DV_M147"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that inhaled analgesics could be a <a NAME="_DV_M149"></a>$5
billio<a NAME="_DV_M150"></a>n market (drugs and devices) worldwide based on our
market research estimates. Procedures that could benefit from this treatment
include but are not limited to: Colonoscopy, burn dressing changes, pain relief
pre-diagnosis in ambulance and emergency room, ICU/CCU sedation, dental and oral
surgery procedures, relaxation for MRI diagnosis, office based dermatological or
podiatric procedures<a NAME="_DV_M151"></a>, and certain catheterizations.<a NAME="_DV_M152"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We estimate that total cost per procedure will usually be less than the
combination of sedative hypnotic/reversal agent used today (example Versad&#174 (midazolam)
and reversal agent), and should result in more universally rapid discharge since
the inhalant agents are exhaled relatively quickly (i.e. the sedative hypnotic
agents and their reversal agents have significantly different half lives,
occasionally protein-binding of midazolam results in a patient needing to stay
in post-analgesia recovery for a prolonged period with the attendant physician
and nurse attention.)</p>

<p><a name="_DV_M159">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>In 1994 and 1995, the FDA issued three health
advisories concerning the risk of patient radiation exposure in fluoroscopically
guided procedures. At the same time, Dr. Michael Landi and Dr. Robert Lifeso
started <a NAME="_DV_M160"></a>developing ideas on how to minimize the radiation
exposure to both patients and surgical staff. (Dr. Landi was a Neurosurgical
Resident at Buffalo General Hospital and Dr. Lifeso was Chief of Orthopedic
Surgery at the Erie County Medical Center, also in Buffalo New York.) They
approached Bill Burns who was then the founder, President and CEO of Matrx
Medical. After he left Matr<a NAME="_DV_M161"></a>x, they collaborated on the
idea. Minrad Inc. was incorporated in December 1994 and the Dual Radiation
Targeting System (DRTS&#174) was born.<a NAME="_DV_M162"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with these FDA advisories, there was (and continues to be) an increased
emphasis on developing less invasive surgical techniques that minimize
healthcare costs and provide improved patient outcomes. These procedures

surgical procedures now rely on fluoroscopy, CT-scans or other forms of imaging
to help perform the minimally invasive procedures. The minimally invasive spine
market is estimated to be growing at an overall rate of 40%. Pain management is
growing at around 20%. The increased use of fluoroscopy increased the amount of
radiation exposure the FDA had warned about. One of the other problems of
fluoroscopy use was how to actually locate the subsurface surgical target by
looking at a monitor across the room. Further, there was a &quot;parallax&quot; problem
whereby surface landmarks were not aligned properly to the image. </p>

<p><a name="_DV_M206">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>A line of accessories is a part of the SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup>
system. The three-compartment Tri-Knew<sup>&#8482</sup> battery charger charges,
analyses and conditions the 12-volt NiCad battery packs that power the device.
There is also a sterile disposable drape that covers the SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup>
and C-arm source so that it can be placed in the sterile field. This patented
platform drape has an optically correct window that must be used with the
SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup> so that the accuracy of the laser beam is not

annual growth rate of 6%. <a NAME="_DV_M209"></a>We also estimate that we can
realize operating margins approaching 70% from the sale of these products when
production reaches a certain minimum scale. <a NAME="_DV_M210"></a>With these

operating theater<a NAME="_DV_M218"></a>, can visualize that<a NAME="_DV_M219"></a>
he is aligned with the subsurface target. The FDA has accepted an accuracy claim
of <u>+</u> 3mm at a depth of 100mm. An example of where this can be critical is
in biopsies. Physicians are most concerned with a &quot;false negative&quot; where the
malignant character of the lesion is missed and appropriate intervention is not
taken until after it has grown and spread. Particularly when caught in the early
stages, the subsurface lesion may only be less than 1 cm in size. </p>

<p>Real
Time Image Guidance</p>
</b>
<p><a name="_DV_M227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>The SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup> system is &quot;first in
class&quot; without any known competition. Other <a NAME="_DV_M228"></a>navigation
systems, similar to the two systems described previously, use archival data not

<b>
<p>Strategy</p>
</b>
<p><a name="_DV_M232">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>The overall image guidance strategy is based upon
follow-up consumable business. Every SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup> sold or otherwise
<a NAME="_DV_M233"></a>placed provides a potential revenue stream of
consumables. The cumulative universe of devices in use provides a growing source
of demand for Light Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup> product line extensions.</p>
<i>
<p><a name="_DV_M234">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>OEM:</i> <a NAME="_DV_M235"></a>We are working with
C-arm manufacturers to have the technology built into factory units.
<a NAME="_DV_M236"></a>If SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup> becomes more widely known and
<a NAME="_DV_M237"></a>a standard of care,<a NAME="_DV_M238"></a> we want to
create the concept of &quot;Minrad Inside&quot; similar to &quot;Intel&#174&quot; inside&quot;.</p>
<i>
<p><a name="_DV_M239">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>Therapy Partners:</i> Several companies have
<a NAME="_DV_C221">begun discussions with us </a><a NAME="_DV_M240"></a>
regarding building Light Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup> technology into their equipment.
Such discussions are in an early stage. We believe that the <a NAME="_DV_M241">
</a>additional accuracy and safety of <a NAME="_DV_M242"></a>the Minrad
technology<a NAME="_DV_M243"></a> combined with their technology or therapy<a NAME="_DV_M244"></a>
would greatly enhance their competitive advantage. From our <a NAME="_DV_M245">
</a>perspective, <a NAME="_DV_C229">if another company utilized Light Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup>
technology, </a><a NAME="_DV_M246"></a>there would be another sales organization
providing leads and helping to pull through SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup> sales<a NAME="_DV_C230">
which, </a><a NAME="_DV_M247"></a>in turn<a NAME="_DV_C232">,</a><a NAME="_DV_M248"></a>
would pull through additional Light Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup> sales. </p>
<i>
<p><a name="_DV_M249">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital Synergies:</i> Hospital purchasing
departments do not want to add extra SKU's to their inventory. Since most Light
Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup> products are priced competitively against similar commodity
products, they can be utilized in procedures when the SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup>
is not used or required. However, the commodity products do not &quot;light up&quot; and
provide the same accuracy when the SabreSource<sup>&#8482</sup> is used. We believe
that hospitals <a NAME="_DV_M250"></a>will be encouraged to standardize on Light
Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup> products to minimize their inventory.</p>
<p><a name="_DV_M251">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>The initial marketing emphasis
will be on anesthesiologists and the pain management market segment because of
the call point similarities with the anesthetic business. Pain management
clinics have a higher patient volume with shorter procedures and patient
recovery time than hospital procedures. In a typical clinic<a NAME="_DV_M253"></a>
a physician may perform from 10 to 15 procedures per day, almost all of which
use fluoroscopic guidance. The Light Sabre<sup>&#8482</sup> usage will be higher and
the selling cycle from initial evaluation to actual purchase tends to involve
fewer people and is more rapid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the preceding sections, we have set forth the estimated size of the
markets (U.S. and/or world markets) for certain classes of products that we sell
or plan to sell. These estimates are based on publicly available information and
on assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Although our research does show
the potential for significant product sales, our estimate should not be viewed
by a potential investor in this offering as any kind of guarantee that we will
in fact achieve any level of future revenues or sales of any particular product.
We face actual or potential competition for all of our products, and in most
cases our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing,

expires in December 2006, with a renewal option. <a NAME="_DV_M271"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also own a 28,587 square-foot pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on 4

<p>Manufacturing</p>
</b>
<p><a name="_DV_M273">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>At this time, our manufacturing strategy for our

produce bulk isoflurane and enflurane, which are manufactured from raw

packaged on site into 100mL and 250mL bottles prepared for distribution. We
expect to begin producing and shipping sevoflurane in April 2004 after

<b>
<p>Restrictions on Transfer</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our outstanding shares were sold under valid exemptions from the registration
requirements of Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by SEC Rule 506 of
Regulation D and none of the shares may be resold or transferred unless the
transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities law is
available and complied with. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, Rule 144 under the Securities Act governs the resale of
securities purchased in unregistered offerings, including this offering.
Generally, sales of securities can only be made in reliance upon Rule 144 if (a)
the shares have been held for at least one year, the class of securities is then
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the shares are sold in
limited amounts through a broker into a public market, and the seller files a
Form 144 with the SEC, or (b) the shares have been held for 2 years and the
holder is not and has not been an affiliate of Minrad during the three months
prior to the sale, the shares may be sold in unlimited amounts and without
further conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no public market for our common stock. Unless we register our common
stock under the Securities Exchange Act and file all required reports under that
Act, no public market can develop, and the exemption for resale under Rule 144
based upon a one year holding period will not be available. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absent compliance with Rule 144, the shares generally may not be re-sold
unless their sale is registered under the Securities Act. A restrictive legend
in substantially the following form will be imprinted on the certificates
representing the shares and stop transfer orders or other appropriate
instructions will be maintained against the transfer of the shares on our
transfer records or those of our transfer agent:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The securities represented by this Certificate have not been registered
    under the Securities Act of 1933 (the &quot;Act&quot;). The securities have been
    acquired for investment purposes and may not be sold, transferred, pledged
    or otherwise disposed of in the absence of an effective Registration
    Statement for the securities under the Act or an opinion of counsel
    satisfactory to the issuer that the proposed disposition will not violate
    Section 5 of the Act.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
<p align="center">-42-</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shares may not be transferred unless (a) a registration statement is in
effect under the Securities Act covering your proposed transfer and you make the
transfer in accordance with such registration statement, or (b) you sell the
shares in a transaction exempt from the Securities Act registration
requirements. In case of any transfer under clause (b), you must notify us of
your proposed transfer and, at our request, furnish us with an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to us that your transfer will not require
registration under the Securities Act. </p>
<b>
<p>Registration Rights.</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain common shareholders and warrant holders have been granted similar
demand and &quot;piggyback&quot; registration rights with respect to shares of common
stock (and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise the warrants)
pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement among the parties. The
form of Registration Rights Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating expenses for Fiscal 2004
of $4,246,000 increased sharply from Fiscal 2003 by $ 913,000, 22%. This was
almost entirely due to increased finance cost related to audit, headcount
expense, the merger with TAC and preparation for MINRAD as a public entity.
Finance &amp; Administrative increased $811000, 36%, to $2,228,000. Research &amp;
Development expenses, $1,273,000, 31% of revenue, were essentially flat (up
$4,000) compared to fiscal 2003. Sales and Marketing expense, $744,000, were up
$98,000, 13%, on higher volume from the prior period. The Operating expense
reduction from Fiscal 2002 to 2003 of $801,000 was primarily due to a
substantial reduction in personnel in 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-operating costs for Fiscal
2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 showed a decrease of $129,000, 21% in interest
expense due to the conversion of debt to common stock during the year. There
were non-cash costs of $713,000 reflecting the inducement cost for convertible
debt holders to convert to equity as part of our restructuring for Fiscal 2004.
Interest expense increased $112,000 between Fiscal 2002 and 2003 due to the
increase use of debt to fund operations. The bottom line of Fiscal 2002 was
favorably adjusted by $1,647,000 due to a change in accounting principle to
record the negative goodwill of its Fiscal 2001 acquisition.</p>
<u><b>
<p>Financial Condition</p>
</b></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the period covered by
the financial statements, MINRAD funded its operations primarily through
borrowings and private sales of its equity securities. Fund Raising activity and
the conversion of debt to equity resulted in a reduction in Stockholders deficit
between periods from $(5,887,000) in FY 2003 to $(3,309,000) in FY2004.
Operating losses of $ 4.7 million in the current period were offset by the
benefit from raising of $3.6 million new equity funding and $3.0 million of the
conversion of debt to equity investment. The company sustained net losses of
$2.4 million and $2.8 million in Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2003 respectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINRAD International plans to fund
2005 operations through a combination of additional equity investment, improved
operating performance and an expanded bank line. Management estimates that $9
million in new equity will be required to fund operations in the coming year.</p>

Minrad Inc. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Minrad Inc. as of September
30, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations, changes in
stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Minrad Inc. as of September
30, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company adopted

Inc. (the Company) is an acute medical device and pharmaceutical company. The
Company's products are sold predominantly in North America and Europe. The
Company's medical device products are used in the hospital acute care and
operating room market. The Company is in the process of redesigning these
products, resulting in minimal revenue during the years ended September 30, 2003
and 2002. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The pharmaceutical aspect of the business is engaged in the manufacture and sale
of generic inhalation anesthetics that are primarily used for human and
veterinary surgical interventions. Approximately 90% of the Company's 2003 and
2002 sales revenue is generated from the sale of these generic liquid anesthetic
products. The Company's products are sold primarily in North America, Europe and
Asia.</font> </p>

- - Effective December 15, 2000, the Company acquired certain assets and
liabilities of Medeva Pharmaceuticals PA, Inc. (Medeva) located in Lehigh
Valley, Pennsylvania. Medeva is a manufacturer of generic liquid anesthetics. As
a result of the purchase, the Company recorded negative goodwill of $2,237,474
that was being amortized over its useful life, estimated to be three years.
Accumulated amortization as a result of this transaction amounted to $590,445 as
of September 30, 2001. </font></p>

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, titled &quot;Business Combinations&quot;.
The Company adopted the provisions of this standard during the year ended
September 30, 2002. Accordingly, the net book value of the negative goodwill as
of September 30, 2001, amounting to $1,647,029, was written off and recognized
as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying statement
of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002. </font></p>

the receivable balance is outstanding beyond its scheduled due date. On a
periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts, based on a history of past write-offs and
collections and current credit conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts
was $355,000 as of September 30, 2003 ($155,000 - 2002). No interest is accrued

the Company's pharmaceutical operations. The land and facilities were appraised
at a fair value of $1,650,000 as of December 8, 2003. The related machinery and
equipment were appraised at a fair value of approximately $4,100,000 as of March
27, 2001, assuming continued use. At the date of acquisition, the fair value of
the assets exceeded the consideration paid. Accordingly, in accordance with FAS
141 &quot;Business Combinations,&quot; there was no value assigned to these assets at the

could adversely affect the Company's ability to pursue its strategy and could
negatively affect operations in future periods. The accompanying financial

Management has valued the common stock warrants at their date of grant utilizing
the Black Scholes pricing model. In arriving at their fair market value at the
date of grant, the Company considered, among other things, historic equity
transactions for all classes of its stock, the liquidity of the common stock,
volatility and the liquidation preference of the Series A and B preferred
shares. As a result of this analysis, the assumed value of the underlying common
stock at the date of grant was substantially less than its exercise price,
resulting in no value being assigned to the common stock warrants.</font><b><font size="2" face="sans-serif">

A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the note has been allocated to
the detachable warrants and has been classified as a note discount and
additional paid-in capital. Management determined the value of the warrants and
note discount utilizing the Black Scholes pricing model. The assumed fair value
of the underlying Series B Preferred Stock used in the model was determined to
be the par value of $1.15, based on past transactions involving this Series of
stock. The note discount is classified as a reduction of the note amount in the
balance sheet and amortized into income over the term of the note as additional
interest expense related to the note.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Based on the reduction of the note carrying amount as a result of the detachable
warrant note discount, the effective conversion rate of the notes results in a
beneficial conversion feature. The value of this beneficial conversion feature
is determined at issuance by comparing the effective conversion price to the
fair value of the underlying stock, multiplied by the number of shares into
which the debt is convertible. This beneficial conversion feature is classified
as a reduction of the note amount in the balance sheet and amortized into income
over the term of the note as additional interest expense related to the note.</font>

    promissory note, secured by a mortgage on certain property. The loan is
    payable in monthly installments of $11,360, including interest at the rate
    of 13.5%, through November 2016. In connection with the loan, the Company
    entered into a holdback agreement with the lender. Under this agreement the
    lender retained $68,162 of the original proceeds as a reserve to ensure
    payment of monthly payments. This balance, less amounts applied against
    missed principal and interest payments, is held by the lender and included
    in other assets on the accompanying balance sheet. As of September 30, 2003,
    the Company was delinquent with respect to certain payments, resulting in a
    default, as defined by the agreement. Accordingly, the entire balance has
    been classified as current.</font></td>

At September 30, 2003, the Company has operating loss carry forwards (NOL's) of
approximately $17,830,000 ($15,309,000 - 2002) and research and development tax
credits of approximately $207,000 ($168,000 - 2002), which begin to expire in
the year 2011 through 2023. The utilization of the operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards may be limited as a result of ownership changes which have
occurred. Due to the uncertainty as to the Company's ability to generate
sufficient taxable income in the future and utilize the NOL's before they
expire, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the gross
deferred tax assets to zero. </font></p>

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock option plan.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been charged to earnings for options
granted in the years ended September 30, 2003 or 2002 since all such options
have an exercise price greater than the market value on the date of grant.</font>

Had the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, the net loss
in the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 would not have been substantially
different. Management has valued the options at their date of grant utilizing
the Black Scholes pricing model. Based on the liquidation preference of the
Series A and B preferred shares, the assumed value of the underlying common
stock was not significant in relation to the exercise price, resulting no value
being assigned to the options. The following weighted-average assumptions were
utilized in the fair value calculations: </font></p>

Various claims and actions against the Company considered normal to the

Management believes that the resolution of such claims and actions should not
have any material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial

On February 16, 2003, a winter snowstorm shut down Minrad's Pennsylvania
manufacturing plant for a period of weeks, and limited subsequent production
until June 30, 2003. A business interruption claim was filed against the Chubb
Group. An initial payment of $500,000 was received in August 2003, which is
recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. The claim is pending and the ultimate
results are undeterminable at this time. </font></p>

An agreement was entered into to extend the KKP guarantee of the Wachovia demand
note (see Note 4). This agreement calls for an additional grant of 50,000 common
stock warrants at the beginning of each month that the debt is not repaid,
beginning in October 2004. As of the date of release of these financial
statements, warrants have been issued that will entitle the KKP to purchase an
additional 150,000 shares of common stock at $ 0.75 per share and will expire on
varying dates through October 30, 2009. These warrants were valued at $117,054
at the date of grant. </font></p>

The Company repaid various demand notes payable outstanding as of September 30,

various notes payable outstanding as of September 30, 2003 aggregating
$2,253,916 and accrued interest of $173,547 into 2,910,538 shares of common
stock. The holders of certain of these notes were offered conversion terms that
resulted in the issuance of shares of common stock in excess of the amount
stated in the original agreement, as well as 475,000 warrants to purchase common
stock. Accordingly, the conversion was considered to be induced by the Company,
resulting in the fair value of the shares issued in excess of the original terms
being recorded as a debt conversion cost in the statement of operations. This
induced conversion cost amounted to $713,390. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Company obtained additional convertible demand notes payable from STSG, NEP

interest at the rate of 8% and where subsequently converted, along with accrued
interest of $16,287, into 668,383 shares of common stock.</font> </p>

On July 15, 2004, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of
Exchange (the Agreement) with Technology Acquisition Corporation (TAC),
Technology Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc. (AS) and certain majority shareholders
of TAC. Under the terms of the Agreement, all outstanding stock of the Company
as of the effective date will be exchange for shares of TAC stock on a
one-for-one basis and TAC will be merged with and into AS, with AS being the
surviving corporation whose name will be changed to Minrad International, Inc.
TAC is a relatively inactive public company shell listed for quotation on the
Over The Counter Bulletin Board. As a result of the transaction, the former
stockholders of the Company will own approximately 82% of the outstanding shares
of TAC and will gain control of the Board of Directors. Accordingly, the
transaction will be accounted for in accordance with Securities and Exchange,
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 2:A:2, whereby the Company is deemed to be the
accounting acquirer of TAC, followed by a recapitalization. The assets and
liabilities of TAC as of the date of acquisition will be recorded at their fair
value and the operations of the consolidated financial statements will include
the activities of TAC starting with the date of the acquisition.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On August 25, 2004, the Agreement was amended to permit TAC to sell up to 2.5
million shares of its common stock at a price not less than $1.75 per share,
prior to the completion of the merger, provided that the proceeds from the
transaction are loaned to the Company to finance its operations. As of the date
of the issuance of this report, loans amounted to $353,000 have been made to the
Company from TAC. These loans bear interest at the rate of 6%, mature in March
2005 and hold a subordinated collateral interest in the assets of the Company.
The closing of the Agreement is subject to certain covenants, conditions and
representations, and various due diligence requirements. </font></p>

Business Description</b> </font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">- Minrad,
Inc. (the Company) is an acute medical device and pharmaceutical company. The
medical device aspect of the business is engaged in the development, manufacture
and selling of patented technology which utilizes a laser targeting system or
the Dual Radiation Targeting System (DRTS) to both reduce radiation exposure and
improve accuracy of interventional procedures. The Company's products, including
the DRTS platform unit and other complementary accessories and disposable
products, are used in the hospital acute care and operating room market. The
Company's rights to commercialize this technology were obtained under exclusive
licensing with the DRTS patent holder, the Research Foundation of the State
University of New York at Buffalo (the Foundation), including the laser
targeting system and will be the sole holder of such patents. Development of the
Company's laser targeting system was completed in 1997, and the Company received
acceptance to market the DRTS domestically from the Food and Drug Administration
and received a certificate of entry into the European Union. The Company's
products are sold predominantly in North America and Europe. The Company is in
the process of redesigning this product, resulting in minimal revenue during the
years ended September 30, 2004. </font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2" face="sans-serif">The pharmaceutical
aspect of the business is engaged in the manufacture and sale of generic
inhalation anesthetics that are primarily used for human and veterinary surgical
interventions. Over 90% of the Company's 2004 sales revenue is generated from
the sale of these generic liquid anesthetic products. The Company's products are
sold primarily in North America, Europe and Asia.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Accounts Receivable</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> - The
Company carries its accounts receivable at cost less an allowance for doubtful
accounts. An account receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of
the receivable balance is outstanding beyond its scheduled due date. On a
periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts, based on a history of past write-offs and
collections and current credit conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts
was $394,000 as of September 30, 2004. No interest is accrued on accounts
receivable. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Inventories</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> - Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. A reserve for
slow-moving and obsolete inventory is established for all inventory deemed
potentially non-saleable by management in the period in which it is determined
to be potentially non-saleable. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Property and Equipment</b> </font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">-
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from
three to five years. Depreciation expense for the Company amounted to
approximately $140,000 for the year ended September 30, 2004.</font> </p>

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Income Taxes</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> - The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
&quot;Accounting for Income Taxes.&quot; The standard requires the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes and the recognition of future tax
benefits, measured by enacted tax rates, attributed to deductible temporary
differences, and net operating loss carry forwards to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not, as well as future tax
obligations attributed to taxable temporary differences.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Revenue Recognition</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif"><b> </b>-
The Company recognizes revenue from products sales when the goods are shipped to
the customer and title has been transferred. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Research and Development Costs</b> </font></i>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">- All costs related to research and development
are expensed as incurred. These costs include labor and other operating expenses
related to product development, as well as costs to obtain regulatory approval.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Advertising</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> - The Company
expenses advertising as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $20,000
for the year ended September 30, 2004. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Stock Based Compensation</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif"> -
The Company accounts for its stock option plans utilizing the intrinsic value
method specified under APB Opinion No. 25, &quot;Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees&quot;. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options
issued to employees as long as the exercise price is greater than or equal to
the market value of the common stock at the date of grant. In accordance with
SFAS 123, &quot;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,&quot; the Company discloses the
summary of proforma effects to reported net loss as if the Company had elected
to recognize compensation costs based on the fair value of the employee options
at the grant date. Stock warrants issued to non-employees are recognized as
compensation expense based upon the fair value of the consideration received or
the fair value of the equity instruments issued, which ever is more reliably
measurable. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Accounting of Estimates</b> </font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">- The
process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America requires the use
of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled
transactions and events as at the date of the financial statements. Accordingly,
actual results may differ from estimated amounts. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">
- - The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates
of their fair value due to their short maturity. Based on the borrowing rates
currently available to the Company for loans similar to its term debt and notes
payable, the fair value approximates its carrying amount. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Concentration of Credit Risk</b></font></i><font size="2" face="sans-serif">
- - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of
credit risk consist of cash accounts in financial institutions. Although the
cash accounts exceed the federally insured deposit amount, management does not
anticipate nonperformance by the financial institutions.</font> </p>

The Company expects to and has devoted substantial capital resources to expand
operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and expects such
activities will be funded from the issuance of additional equity or debt

at all. Failure to raise the funds necessary to finance future cash requirements

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, Minrad acquired control of the Company on the date
of this Agreement through a reverse merger of Minrad and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company; and </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, pending the merger, the parties agreed that under
the Letter Agreement equity funding raised by Chadbourn for the Company would be

assisted Minrad in placing 3,201,084 shares at $1.25 per share, and Chadbourn
has assisted the Company in placing 585,257 shares at $1.75 per share; and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="center"><u><b>A G R E E M E N T</p>
</b></u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Warrant Certificates</u>. The warrant certificates to
be delivered pursuant to this Agreement (the &quot;Warrant Certificates&quot;) shall be in
the forms set forth in <u>Exhibit A</u> or <u>Exhibit B</u> attached hereto and
made a part hereof, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions
and other variations as are required or permitted by this Warrant Agreement.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Right to Exercise Warrants</u>. Each Warrant may be
exercised from the date of this Agreement until 11:59 P.M. (Eastern Standard
Time) on the date that is seven (7) years after the date of this Agreement (the
&quot;Expiration Date&quot;). Each Warrant not exercised on or before the Expiration Date
shall expire. Each Warrant shall entitle its holder to purchase from the Company
the number of shares of common stock indicated in the Warrant (each such share
being an &quot;Exercise Share) at the per share exercise price set forth on the
warrant certificate, subject to adjustment as set forth below (the &quot;Exercise
Price&quot;).</p>
<p ALIGN="center">1 of 16</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares
of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Warrants or to deliver Warrant
Certificates which evidence fractional shares of capital stock. In the event
that a fraction of an Exercise Share would, except for the provisions of this
paragraph 2, be issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall pay
to the holder exercising the Warrant an amount in cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the current market value of the Exercise Share. For purposes of
this paragraph 2, the current market value shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Shares are traded in the over-the-counter market
and not on any national securities exchange and not in the NASDAQ Reporting
System, the average of the mean between the last bid and asked prices per share,
as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc., or an equivalent generally
accepted reporting service, for the last business day prior to the date on which
the Warrant is exercised, or, if not so reported, the average of the closing bid
and asked prices for a Share as furnished to the Company by any member of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., selected by the Company for
that purpose.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Shares are listed or traded on a national
securities exchange or in the NASDAQ Reporting System, the closing price on the
principal national securities exchange on which they are so listed or traded or
in the NASDAQ Reporting System, as the case may be, on the last business day
prior to the date of the exercise of the Warrant. The closing price referred to
in this Clause (b) shall be the last reported sales price or, in case no such
reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid
and asked prices, in either case on the national securities exchange on which
the Shares are then listed on in the NASDAQ Reporting System; or</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if no such closing price or closing bid and asked prices
are available, as determined in any reasonable manner as may be prescribed by
the Board of Directors of the Company.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates</u>. In case
any of the Warrant Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed
prior to the Expiration Date, the Company shall issue and deliver, in exchange
and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate,
or in lieu of and in substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or
destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an
equivalent right or interest.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reservation of Shares</u>. The Company will at all
times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the
aggregate of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, or its authorized and
issued Common Stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to
satisfy its obligation to issue Exercise Shares upon exercise of Warrants, the
full number of Exercise Shares deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding

<p>THIS CERTIFIES THAT, ______________________, or any person or entity to whom
the interest in this Warrant is lawfully transferred (&quot;Holder&quot;) is entitled to
purchase the above number (as adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof) of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock (the &quot;Shares&quot;) of Minrad
International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the &quot;Company), having an Exercise
Price as set forth above, subject to the provisions and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement between the Company and
Cagan McAfee Capital Partners, LLC, dated December 15, 2004 (the &quot;Warrant
Agreement&quot;). The exercise price, as adjusted from time to time as provided
herein, is referred to as the &quot;Exercise Price.&quot;</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Term</u>. The purchase right represented by this Warrant is
exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time commencing on the Date of Grant
and ending on the Expiration Date, after which time the Warrant shall be void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Method of Exercise; Payment; Issuance of New Warrant</u>. Subject to
Section 1 hereof, the right to purchase Shares represented by this Warrant may
be exercised by Holder, in whole or in part, for the total number of Shares
remaining available for exercise by the surrender of this Warrant (with the
notice of exercise form attached hereto as Exhibit A duly executed) at the
principal office of the Company and by the payment to the Company, by check made
payable to the Company drawn on a United States bank and for United States
funds, or by delivery to the Company of evidence of cancellation of indebtedness
of the Company to such Holder, of an amount equal to the then applicable
Exercise Price per share multiplied by the number of Shares then being purchased
or by net exercise pursuant to Section 6 hereof. In the event of any exercise of
the purchase right represented by this Warrant, certificates for the Shares so
purchased shall be promptly delivered to Holder and, unless this Warrant has
been fully exercised or has expired, a new Warrant representing the portion of
the Shares, if any, with respect to which this Warrant shall not then have been
exercised shall also be promptly delivered to Holder.</p>
<p align="center">7 of 16</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Exercise Price</u>. The Exercise Price at which this Warrant may be
exercised shall be the Exercise Price, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Section 4 hereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reclassification, Reorganization, Consolidation or Merger</u>. In the
case of any reclassification of the Shares, or any reorganization, consolidation
or merger of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a merger
or reorganization with respect to which the Company is the continuing
corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of the Shares),
the Company, or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall execute a
new warrant providing that the Holder shall have the right to exercise such new
warrant and upon such exercise to receive, in lieu of each Share theretofore
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities, money
and property receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization,
consolidation or merger by a holder of Shares for each Share. Such new warrant
shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4 including, without
limitation, adjustments to the Exercise Price and to the number of Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The provisions of this Section 4 shall
similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, consolidations
or mergers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Transferability and Negotiability of Warrant</u>. This Warrant may not
be transferred or assigned in whole or in part without compliance with
applicable federal and state securities laws by the transferor and the
transferee (including, without limitation, the delivery of investment
representation letters and legal opinions reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, if reasonably requested by the Company). Subject to the provisions of
this Section&nbsp;5, title to this Warrant may be transferred in the same manner as a
negotiable instrument transferable by endorsement and delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Net Exercise</u>. In lieu of exercising this Warrant for cash, the
Holder may elect to exchange this Warrant for Shares equal to the value of this
Warrant by surrender of this Warrant, together with notice of such election, at
the principal office of the Company, in which event the Company shall issue to
the holder a number of Shares computed using the following formula:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Investment Intent; Accredited Investor</u>. Holder
represents and warrants to the Company that Holder is acquiring this Warrants
for investment purposes and with no present intention of distributing or
reselling the Warrants or any of the Shares issueable upon exercise of the
Warrant.. Holder represents that it is an &quot;accredited investor&quot; within the
meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) and has
executed and delivered the Investment Representation Statement that accompanies
this Agreement.</p>

hereof, a sufficient number of Shares to permit the exercise hereof in full.
Such Shares, when issued in compliance with the provisions of this Warrant and
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, will be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. No Holder of this Warrant, as such,
shall, prior to the exercise of this Warrant, be entitled to vote or receive
dividends or be deemed to be a stockholder of the Company for any purpose, nor
shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon Holder, as
such, any rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or
withhold consent to any corporate action, receive notice of meetings, receive
dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise. Upon receipt of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or
destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in
form and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon
surrender and cancellation of such Warrant, the Company at its expense will
execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like date and tenor. The
terms and provisions of this Warrant shall inure to the benefit of, and be
binding upon, the Company and the Holder hereof and their respective successors
and assigns. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
the State of Nevada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities, I, the
Purchaser, represent to the Company the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition, and
have acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and
knowledgeable decision to acquire the Securities. I am purchasing these
Securities for my own account for investment purposes only and not with a view
to, or for the resale in connection with, any &quot;distribution&quot; thereof for
purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&quot;Securities Act&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of my investment intent
as expressed herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from
registration is otherwise available. In addition, I understand that the
certificate evidencing the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which
prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such
registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the Purchaser
satisfactory to the Company or receipt of a no-action letter from the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware of the provisions of Rule&nbsp;144, promulgated under the
Securities Act, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of
&quot;restricted securities&quot; acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer
thereof (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, if applicable, including, among other
things: the availability of certain public information about the Company; the
resale occurring not less than one year after the party has purchased and paid
for the securities to be sold; the sale being made through a broker in an
unsolicited &quot;broker's transaction&quot; or in transactions directly with a market
maker (as said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended); and the amount of securities being sold during any three month period
not exceeding the specified limitations stated therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that at the time I wish to sell the Securities there
may be no public market upon which to make such a sale, and that, even if such a
public market then exists, the Company may not be satisfying the current public
information requirements of Rule&nbsp;144, and that, in such event, I may be
precluded from selling the Securities under Rule&nbsp;144 even if the one-year
minimum holding period had been satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that in the event all of the requirements of
Rule&nbsp;144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance
with Regulation&nbsp;A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and
that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule&nbsp;144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the
SEC has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an
exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such
persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so
at their own risk.</p>

<p>THIS CERTIFIES THAT, ______________________, or any person or entity to whom
the interest in this Warrant is lawfully transferred (&quot;Holder&quot;) is entitled to
purchase the above number (as adjusted pursuant to Section 4 hereof) of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock (the &quot;Shares&quot;) of Minrad
International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the &quot;Company), having an Exercise
Price as set forth above, subject to the provisions and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement between the Company and
Cagan McAfee Capital Partners, LLC, dated December 15, 2004 (the &quot;Warrant
Agreement&quot;). The exercise price, as adjusted from time to time as provided
herein, is referred to as the &quot;Exercise Price.&quot;</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Term</u>. The purchase right represented by this Warrant is
exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time commencing on the Date of Grant
and ending on the Expiration Date, after which time the Warrant shall be void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Method of Exercise; Payment; Issuance of New Warrant</u>. Subject to
Section 1 hereof, the right to purchase Shares represented by this Warrant may
be exercised by Holder, in whole or in part, for the total number of Shares
remaining available for exercise by the surrender of this Warrant (with the
notice of exercise form attached hereto as Exhibit A duly executed) at the
principal office of the Company and by the payment to the Company, by check made
payable to the Company drawn on a United States bank and for United States
funds, or by delivery to the Company of evidence of cancellation of indebtedness
of the Company to such Holder, of an amount equal to the then applicable
Exercise Price per share multiplied by the number of Shares then being purchased
or by net exercise pursuant to Section 6 hereof. In the event of any exercise of
the purchase right represented by this Warrant, certificates for the Shares so
purchased shall be promptly delivered to Holder and, unless this Warrant has
been fully exercised or has expired, a new Warrant representing the portion of
the Shares, if any, with respect to which this Warrant shall not then have been
exercised shall also be promptly delivered to Holder.</p>
<p align="center">12 of 16</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Exercise Price</u>. The Exercise Price at which this Warrant may be
exercised shall be the Exercise Price, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Section 4 hereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. <u>Reclassification, Reorganization, Consolidation or Merger</u>. In the
case of any reclassification of the Shares, or any reorganization, consolidation
or merger of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a merger
or reorganization with respect to which the Company is the continuing
corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of the Shares),
the Company, or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall execute a
new warrant providing that the Holder shall have the right to exercise such new
warrant and upon such exercise to receive, in lieu of each Share theretofore
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities, money
and property receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization,
consolidation or merger by a holder of Shares for each Share. Such new warrant
shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4 including, without
limitation, adjustments to the Exercise Price and to the number of Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The provisions of this Section 4 shall
similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, consolidations
or mergers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Transferability and Negotiability of Warrant</u>. This Warrant may not
be transferred or assigned in whole or in part without compliance with
applicable federal and state securities laws by the transferor and the
transferee (including, without limitation, the delivery of investment
representation letters and legal opinions reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, if reasonably requested by the Company). Subject to the provisions of
this Section&nbsp;5, title to this Warrant may be transferred in the same manner as a
negotiable instrument transferable by endorsement and delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Net Exercise</u>. In lieu of exercising this Warrant for cash, the
Holder may elect to exchange this Warrant for Shares equal to the value of this
Warrant by surrender of this Warrant, together with notice of such election, at
the principal office of the Company, in which event the Company shall issue to
the holder a number of Shares computed using the following formula:</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Investment Intent; Accredited Investor</u>. Holder
represents and warrants to the Company that Holder is acquiring this Warrants
for investment purposes and with no present intention of distributing or
reselling the Warrants or any of the Shares issueable upon exercise of the
Warrant.. Holder represents that it is an &quot;accredited investor&quot; within the

<p ALIGN="center">13 OF 16</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Miscellaneous</u>. The Company covenants that it will at all times
reserve and keep available, solely for the purpose of issue upon the exercise
hereof, a sufficient number of Shares to permit the exercise hereof in full.
Such Shares, when issued in compliance with the provisions of this Warrant and

issued, fully paid and non-assessable. No Holder of this Warrant, as such,
shall, prior to the exercise of this Warrant, be entitled to vote or receive
dividends or be deemed to be a stockholder of the Company for any purpose, nor
shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon Holder, as
such, any rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or
withhold consent to any corporate action, receive notice of meetings, receive
dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise. Upon receipt of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or
destruction, upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in
form and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon
surrender and cancellation of such Warrant, the Company at its expense will
execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like date and tenor. The
terms and provisions of this Warrant shall inure to the benefit of, and be
binding upon, the Company and the Holder hereof and their respective successors
and assigns. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
the State of Nevada.</p>

<u>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT</p>
</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS AGREEMENT is made as of December 15, 2004 between and among MINRAD
INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Nevada corporation (the &quot;Company&quot;), MINRAD INC., a
Delaware corporation (&quot;Minrad&quot;), CAGAN MCAFEE CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC (&quot;CMCP&quot;),
LIVIAKIS FINANCIAL COMMUNICATIONS, INC (&quot;LFC&quot;), LAIRD Q. CAGAN (&quot;Cagan&quot;), ERIC
MCAFEE (&quot;McAfee&quot;), and TOBIN FAMILY TRUST (&quot;Tobin Trust&quot;), (LFC, Cagan, McAfee,
and Tobin Trust being referred to collectively as the &quot;Shareholders&quot;).</p>
<u><b>
<p>Factual Background</p>
</b></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company, Minrad, CMCP, and the Shareholders other than LFC are parties
to a Merger Agreement and Plan of Exchange, dated July 15, 2004, and an
Amendment thereto dated August 24, 2004 (collectively, the &quot;Merger Agreement&quot;).
Section 3(d)(7) of the Merger Agreement provides for the escrow of up to an
aggregate of up to 2,402,500 shares of the Company owned by the Shareholders
with an independent escrow agent, which shares would be held as security for the
Company pending the completion of placements of an aggregate of up to $7.7
million of equity funding by CMCP and its affiliates (including Chadbourn
Securities, Inc. (&quot;Chadbourn&quot;)) for Minrad and the Company under the terms of an
Engagement Letter, dated December 1, 2003, between CMCP and Minrad (the
&quot;Engagement Letter&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties desire to dispense with the use of an escrow and an
independent escrow agent that are provided for in the Merger Agreement. Instead,
they desire to have the Company hold the shares that would have been subject to
escrow subject to this Option Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Merger Agreement, the number of Security Shares to be escrowed
was 5,000,000 times One (1) minus the quotient of (a) the aggregate dollar value
of equity funding theretofore placed by Chadbourn and its affiliates for Minrad
and the Company, divided by (b) 7.7 million (that is, the dollar amount of
equity funding commitment under the Engagement Letter). As of the time of this
Agreement, CMCP's affiliates, including Chadbourn, have placed an aggregate of
$5,538,160 of equity funding for Minrad and the Company (the &quot;Completed
Funding&quot;), the amount remaining to be funded is $2,161,840, and the aggregate
number of shares that would have been subject to escrow under the Engagement
Letter is 1,403,379 (the &quot;Security Shares&quot;).</p>

    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><u>Grant of Options</u>. <br>
    <br>
    Each of the Shareholders hereby grants an option to the Company to purchase
    from the respective Shareholder up to the number of Security Shares set
    opposite that Shareholder's name in Section 2, under the terms of this
    Option Agreement (the &quot;Options&quot;).</p>

    The purchase price of the Security Shares under each of the Options shall be
    $0.0001 per share.</p>
    <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Conditions to Exercisability</u>. </p>
    <p>Each Option will become
    exercisable if Chadbourn and its affiliates fail to obtain, prior to April
    30, 2005 (the &quot;Option Exercisable Date&quot;), an aggregate equity funding of
    $7.7 million for the Company and Minrad under the terms of the Engagement
    Letter. If the Options become exercisable, they will (a) become exercisable
    on the Option Exercisable Date, and (b) be exercisable for the total of each
    Shareholder's Security Shares reduced by a percentage that reflects the
    amount of additional aggregate equity funding placed by Chadbourn and its
    affiliates for the Company and Minrad after the date of this Option
    Agreement and prior to the Option Exercisable Date (the &quot;Additional
    Funding&quot;). Accordingly, if the Options become exercisable, they will become
    exercisable for a percentage of each Shareholder's Security Shares that is
    equal to One (1) minus the quotient of (a) the amount of Additional Funding,
    divided by (b) 2,161,840. </p>

    reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification,
    stock split, stock dividend or combination of shares, then appropriate
    adjustments shall be made in the number and kind of shares as to which the
    Options shall be exercisable, to the end that after any such event, the
    Company's proportionate interest shall be maintained as before the event.
    Such adjustment in the Options shall be made without change in the total
    price applicable to any unexercised portion of the Options (except for any
    change in the aggregate price resulting form rounding-off share quantities
    or prices) and with any necessary corresponding adjustment in the option
    price per share. Any such adjustment made by the Company will be final and
    binding upon the Shareholder, the Company and all other interested parties.</p>

Section 8 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such
indemnified party under this Section 8 if and to the extent the indemnifying
party is materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall

be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the
indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to
assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such
action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses

the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and
the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that
such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact
that this Section 8 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii)

<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In consideration for the agreement
of Cagan McAfee Capital Partners, LLC (&quot;CMCP&quot;) to act on behalf of Minrad, Inc.
(the &quot;Company&quot;) pursuant to the attached Engagement Letter dated as of November
20, 2003, the Company agrees (the &quot;Indemnitor&quot;) to indemnify and hold harmless
CMCP, its affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, agents,
shareholders, consultants, employees and controlling persons (within the meaning
of the Securities Act of 1933) (CMCP and each such other person or entity are
hereinafter referred to as an &quot;Indemnified Person&quot;), to the extent lawful, from
and against any losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities or actions in
respect thereof (collectively, &quot;Losses&quot;), as they may be incurred (including
reasonable legal fees and other expenses as incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing, defending, paying, settling or compromising any
Losses, whether or not in connection with any pending or threatened litigation
in which any Indemnified Person is a named party) to which any of them may
become subject (including in any settlement effected with the Indemnitor's
consent) and which are related to or arise out of any act, omission, disclosure
(written or oral), transaction or event arising out of, contemplated by, or
related to the Engagement Letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indemnitor will not, however,
be responsible under the foregoing provisions with respect to any Losses to an
Indemnified Person to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have determined by a final judgment that such Losses resulted primarily from
actions taken or omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Person due to his gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. If multiple claims are brought
against CMCP in an arbitration, with respect to at least one of which
indemnification is permitted under applicable law and provided for under this
agreement, any arbitration award shall be conclusively deemed to be based on
claims as to which indemnification is permitted and provided for, except to the
extent the arbitration award expressly states that the award, or any portion
thereof, is based solely on a claim as to which indemnification is not
available. No indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of
any action for which indemnification is claimed hereunder without the written
consent of the Indemnitor. No expenses shall be forwarded to any Indemnified
Party unless such party agrees in writing to reimburse the Indemnitor for such
forwarded expenses in the event it is determined that such Indemnified Party was
not entitled to indemnification hereunder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the indemnity referred to in
this agreement should be, for any reason whatsoever, unenforceable, unavailable
or otherwise insufficient to hold each Indemnified Person harmless, the
Indemnitor shall pay to or on behalf of each Indemnified Person contributions
for Losses so that each Indemnified Person ultimately bears only a portion of
such Losses as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by and
the relative fault of each such Indemnified Person, respectively, on the one
hand and the Indemnitor on the other hand in connection with the transaction;
provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate contribution of all
Indemnified Persons to all Losses in connection with any transaction exceed the
amount of any fees actually received by CMCP pursuant to the Engagement Letter.
The relative fault of each Indemnified Person and the Indemnitor shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the actions or omissions
to act were by such Indemnified Person or the Indemnitor and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such action to omission to act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indemnitor also agrees that no
Indemnified Person shall have any liability to the Indemnitor or its affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents or shareholders, directly or indirectly,
related to or arising out of the Engagement Letter, except Losses incurred by
the Indemnitor which a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by
a final judgement to have resulted primarily from actions taken or omitted to be
taken by such Indemnified Person due to its gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct. In no event, regardless of the legal theory advanced, shall
Company or Indemnified Person be liable for any consequential, indirect,
incidental or special damages of any nature. The Indemnitor agrees that without
CMCP's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
it shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding related to the
Engagement Letter unless the settlement, compromise or consent also includes an
express unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability and
obligations arising therefrom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligations of the Indemnitor
referred to above shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Person
may otherwise have and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of any Indemnified
Person and the Indemnitor. It is understood that these obligations of the
Indemnitor will remain operative regardless of any termination or completion of
CMCP's services.</p>

termination of the Executive's employment with the Corporation in a business in
competition with that of the Corporation are essential to the growth and
stability of the business of the Corporation. Accordingly, Executive agrees

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Background</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord and Tenant are parties to
a lawsuit pending in the County Court of the State of New York, County of Erie,
entitled <u>847 Main Street, LLC v. MINRAD, Inc.</u> Index No. I2003-11308 (the
&quot;Litigation&quot;). The Litigation resulted from a dispute between Landlord and
Tenant principally concerning Tenant's failure to pay certain fixed rents,
additional rents and late charges. In order to settle the Litigation, the
parties are entering into this Amendment No. 1 to the Lease Agreement dated
December 13, 2001 (the &quot;Lease&quot;).</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Amendment</p>

consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties agree

following for Section 5 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>

$193,980 per annum, payable in six (6) bi-monthly installments at the rate of
$32,330.00 with a &quot;Late Charge&quot; of 1.5% per month if the rent is not received by
the 7<sup>th</sup> day from the due date thereof. The term &quot;Lease Year&quot; is
defined to mean the twelve (12) calendar month period commencing on January 1,
2002 and each twelve (12) calendar month period thereafter. All rents are
payable in bi-monthly installments of $32,330.00 which bi-monthly installments
shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord one (1) month in advance at Landlord's
address hereinabove set forth, or to such other party or at such other place as
the Landlord may from time to time in writing designate. Therefore, rent
payments are due as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event Tenant shall be in default in the

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event Tenant shall be in default in the

regulations of this Lease excepting those items listed in the above section (a)
above (a &quot;Non-Monetary Default&quot;) and if such Non-Monetary Default is not cured
within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof given by Landlord,
excepting such Non-Monetary Default that cannot be cured completely within such

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act
of 1978 as amended, in the event of the filing of a petition proposing the

Remedies and Damages</p>
</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any Event of Default occurs, Landlord
individually and/or by and through its agent (Duke, Holzman, Yaeger &amp; Photiadis
LLP) may, at its option and in addition to any and all other rights or remedies
provided Landlord in this Lease or at law or equity, immediately, or at any time
thereafter, and without demand or notice (except as provided herein):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without waiving the Event of Default, apply all or
part of the security deposit, if any, to cure the Event of Default and Tenant
shall on demand restore the security deposit to its original amount;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without waiving such Event of Default, apply thereto
any overpayment of rents to curing the Event of Default in lieu of refunding or
crediting the same to Tenant;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Event of Default pertains to work or other
obligations (other than the payment of rent or additional rent) to be performed
by Tenant, without waiving such Event of Default, enter upon the Leased Premises
and perform such work or other obligation, or cause such work or other
obligation to be performed, for the account of Tenant; and Tenant shall on
demand pay to Landlord the cost of performing such work or other obligation plus
five percent (5%) thereof as administrative costs;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; issue a written notice declaring Tenant in monetary
default for nonpayment of fixed rent, additional rent and/or late charges and
providing Tenant with seven (7) days from the issuance of said written notice to
cure all monetary default(s). In the event all monetary defaults are not cured
within the seven (7) day cure period, Landlord may </p>
<p align="center">2</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>issue a written notice stating that the term of this Lease will expire on a
date at least five (5) days thereafter, in which case the term of this Lease
shall automatically expire on the date so fixed in such notice as fully and
completely as if it were the date herein definitely fixed for the expiration of
the term, and all right, title and interest of the Tenant hereunder shall
thereupon cease and expire, and the Tenant shall thereupon quit and surrender
the Leased Premises to Landlord, it being the intention of the parties hereto to
create hereby a conditional limitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any termination of this Lease or
termination of Tenant's rights to possession, Tenant shall pay and be liable for
(on the days fixed herein for the payment thereof) the several installments of
rent and additional rent as and when due, as if this Lease had not been
terminated and as if Landlord had not entered and whether the Leased Premises
are relet or remain vacant in whole or in part, but in the event the Leased
Premises are relet by Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit in the net
sum of rent and additional rent received by the Landlord in reletting after
deduction of all expenses (other than fit out or remodeling) incurred in
reletting the Leased Premises, and in collecting such rents and additional rent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a reletting, Landlord may apply
the rent therefrom first to the payment of Landlord's reasonable expenses
including but not limited to attorney's fees incurred, reasonable expense of
reletting, repairs, brokerage fees, subdividing and then to the payment of rent
and all other sums due from Tenant hereunder, and Tenant shall remain liable for
any deficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Waiver of Rights of Redemption</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or
under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant's being evicted or
dispossessed for any cause, or in the event of Landlord's obtaining possession
of the Leased Premises by reason of the violation, by Tenant, of any of the
covenants or conditions of this Lease, or otherwise.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to substitute the
following for Section 30 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Holding Over</u>. </b>Landlord shall give Tenant at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice if Landlord shall expect or demand that Tenant vacate the Leased
Premises upon the expiration of the term of this Lease or any renewal thereof,
except under circumstances wherein Landlord terminates the Lease pursuant
paragraph 26 of this Lease in which case the thirty (30) day notice provided for
under this paragraph 30 shall not be required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Tenant should continue to
occupy the Leased Premises without having exercised its option to renew (if any)
or without an Agreement in writing as to the terms of such continued possession,
then such additional tenancy shall be on a month-to-month basis at 150% of the
previous existing rental and under the same terms and conditions as provided in
this Lease or the renewal thereof. In case of such continued possession, the
month-to-month tenancy thereby may be canceled at the end of any calendar month
by not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice from either party.</p>
<p align="center">3</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to substitute the
following for Section 31 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Notices</u>. </b>Any notice to Landlord provided for herein shall be deemed to
have been served only when such notice in writing addressed to Landlord, or to
the party to whom rent was last paid, has been deposited in a regular receptacle
of the U.S. Postal Service by registered or certified mail, addressed to the
address hereinabove set forth. Any notice to Tenant as provided for herein, may
be issued by Landlord and/or its agent (Duke, Holzman, Yaeger &amp; Photiadis LLP)
and shall be deemed to have been served only when such notice in writing has
been deposited in a regular receptacle of the U.S. Postal Service by registered
or certified mail addressed to Tenant at the Leased Premises.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to add the following
as Section 39 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Legal Fees</u>. </b>Tenant agrees to pay all fees, including reasonable
attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by Landlord in connection with the
enforcement of any provision of this Lease, including those incurred in
connection with any summary proceeding seeking the removal of Tenant from the
Leased Premises.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneously with the execution of this
Amendment, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord certified funds totaling $77,000.00
($54,156.35 of which are currently being held in escrow) representing (i) the
fixed rents due and owing to date, (ii) the additional rents due and owing to
date, (iii) the late charges due and owing to date, and (iv) Landlord's legal
fees incurred as a result of Tenant's defaults. Because this document is being
executed subsequent to December 1, 2003, the parties agree that the bi-monthly
fixed rent payment in the amount of $32,330.00 covering the period of
January-February 2004 will be due and payable on January 1, 2003. All bi-monthly
fixed rent payments thereafter will be made in accordance Section 5 of the Lease
Amendment as provided herein.</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties hereby ratify, adopt and confirm that
the Lease (as amended hereby) continues in full force and effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment
has been executed by the parties as of the date set forth above even though, for
the convenience of the parties, it may be executed by either or both of them on
some other date or dates.</p>
