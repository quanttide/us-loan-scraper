<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In consideration for the agreement
of Cagan McAfee Capital Partners, LLC (&quot;CMCP&quot;) to act on behalf of Minrad, Inc.
(the &quot;Company&quot;) pursuant to the attached Engagement Letter dated as of November
20, 2003, the Company agrees (the &quot;Indemnitor&quot;) to indemnify and hold harmless
CMCP, its affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, agents,
shareholders, consultants, employees and controlling persons (within the meaning
of the Securities Act of 1933) (CMCP and each such other person or entity are
hereinafter referred to as an &quot;Indemnified Person&quot;), to the extent lawful, from
and against any losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities or actions in
respect thereof (collectively, &quot;Losses&quot;), as they may be incurred (including
reasonable legal fees and other expenses as incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing, defending, paying, settling or compromising any
Losses, whether or not in connection with any pending or threatened litigation
in which any Indemnified Person is a named party) to which any of them may
become subject (including in any settlement effected with the Indemnitor's
consent) and which are related to or arise out of any act, omission, disclosure
(written or oral), transaction or event arising out of, contemplated by, or
related to the Engagement Letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indemnitor will not, however,
be responsible under the foregoing provisions with respect to any Losses to an
Indemnified Person to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have determined by a final judgment that such Losses resulted primarily from
actions taken or omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Person due to his gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. If multiple claims are brought
against CMCP in an arbitration, with respect to at least one of which
indemnification is permitted under applicable law and provided for under this
agreement, any arbitration award shall be conclusively deemed to be based on
claims as to which indemnification is permitted and provided for, except to the
extent the arbitration award expressly states that the award, or any portion
thereof, is based solely on a claim as to which indemnification is not
available. No indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of
any action for which indemnification is claimed hereunder without the written
consent of the Indemnitor. No expenses shall be forwarded to any Indemnified
Party unless such party agrees in writing to reimburse the Indemnitor for such
forwarded expenses in the event it is determined that such Indemnified Party was
not entitled to indemnification hereunder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the indemnity referred to in
this agreement should be, for any reason whatsoever, unenforceable, unavailable
or otherwise insufficient to hold each Indemnified Person harmless, the
Indemnitor shall pay to or on behalf of each Indemnified Person contributions
for Losses so that each Indemnified Person ultimately bears only a portion of
such Losses as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by and
the relative fault of each such Indemnified Person, respectively, on the one
hand and the Indemnitor on the other hand in connection with the transaction;
provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate contribution of all
Indemnified Persons to all Losses in connection with any transaction exceed the
amount of any fees actually received by CMCP pursuant to the Engagement Letter.
The relative fault of each Indemnified Person and the Indemnitor shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the actions or omissions
to act were by such Indemnified Person or the Indemnitor and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such action to omission to act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indemnitor also agrees that no
Indemnified Person shall have any liability to the Indemnitor or its affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents or shareholders, directly or indirectly,
related to or arising out of the Engagement Letter, except Losses incurred by
the Indemnitor which a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by
a final judgement to have resulted primarily from actions taken or omitted to be
taken by such Indemnified Person due to its gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct. In no event, regardless of the legal theory advanced, shall
Company or Indemnified Person be liable for any consequential, indirect,
incidental or special damages of any nature. The Indemnitor agrees that without
CMCP's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
it shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding related to the
Engagement Letter unless the settlement, compromise or consent also includes an
express unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability and
obligations arising therefrom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligations of the Indemnitor
referred to above shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Person
may otherwise have and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of any Indemnified
Person and the Indemnitor. It is understood that these obligations of the
Indemnitor will remain operative regardless of any termination or completion of
CMCP's services.</p>
