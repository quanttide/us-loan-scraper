<p ALIGN="center"><u><b>R E C I T A L S</p>
</b></u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, Minrad and CMCP are parties to a letter agreement
dated December 1, 2003 relating to assistance by CMCP and its affiliates
including Chadbourn in helping Minrad obtain up to $7.7 million of equity
funding (the &quot;Letter Agreement&quot;); and </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, paragraph 2(c) of the Letter Agreement provides that
Minrad will grant investment warrants to CMCP or its affiliates including
Chadbourn to purchase a number of its shares equal to 10% of the number of
shares sold in the equity funding at the same per share purchase prices as the
shares sold in the equity funding; and </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, Minrad acquired control of the Company on the date
of this Agreement through a reverse merger of Minrad and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company; and </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, pending the merger, the parties agreed that under
the Letter Agreement equity funding raised by Chadbourn for the Company would be
treated on the same basis as equity funding for Minrad; and </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement Chadbourn has
assisted Minrad in placing 3,201,084 shares at $1.25 per share, and Chadbourn
has assisted the Company in placing 585,257 shares at $1.75 per share; and</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHEREAS, in consideration of paragraph 2(c) of the Letter

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="center"><u><b>A G R E E M E N T</p>
</b></u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Warrant Certificates</u>. The warrant certificates to
be delivered pursuant to this Agreement (the &quot;Warrant Certificates&quot;) shall be in
the forms set forth in <u>Exhibit A</u> or <u>Exhibit B</u> attached hereto and
made a part hereof, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions
and other variations as are required or permitted by this Warrant Agreement.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Right to Exercise Warrants</u>. Each Warrant may be
exercised from the date of this Agreement until 11:59 P.M. (Eastern Standard
Time) on the date that is seven (7) years after the date of this Agreement (the
&quot;Expiration Date&quot;). Each Warrant not exercised on or before the Expiration Date
shall expire. Each Warrant shall entitle its holder to purchase from the Company
the number of shares of common stock indicated in the Warrant (each such share
being an &quot;Exercise Share) at the per share exercise price set forth on the
warrant certificate, subject to adjustment as set forth below (the &quot;Exercise
Price&quot;).</p>
<p ALIGN="center">1 of 16</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares
of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Warrants or to deliver Warrant
Certificates which evidence fractional shares of capital stock. In the event
that a fraction of an Exercise Share would, except for the provisions of this
paragraph 2, be issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall pay
to the holder exercising the Warrant an amount in cash equal to such fraction
multiplied by the current market value of the Exercise Share. For purposes of
this paragraph 2, the current market value shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Shares are traded in the over-the-counter market
and not on any national securities exchange and not in the NASDAQ Reporting
System, the average of the mean between the last bid and asked prices per share,
as reported by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc., or an equivalent generally
accepted reporting service, for the last business day prior to the date on which
the Warrant is exercised, or, if not so reported, the average of the closing bid
and asked prices for a Share as furnished to the Company by any member of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., selected by the Company for
that purpose.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Shares are listed or traded on a national
securities exchange or in the NASDAQ Reporting System, the closing price on the
principal national securities exchange on which they are so listed or traded or
in the NASDAQ Reporting System, as the case may be, on the last business day
prior to the date of the exercise of the Warrant. The closing price referred to
in this Clause (b) shall be the last reported sales price or, in case no such
reported sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid
and asked prices, in either case on the national securities exchange on which
the Shares are then listed on in the NASDAQ Reporting System; or</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if no such closing price or closing bid and asked prices
are available, as determined in any reasonable manner as may be prescribed by
the Board of Directors of the Company.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates</u>. In case
any of the Warrant Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed
prior to the Expiration Date, the Company shall issue and deliver, in exchange
and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate,
or in lieu of and in substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or
destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an
equivalent right or interest.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reservation of Shares</u>. The Company will at all
times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the
aggregate of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, or its authorized and
issued Common Stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to
satisfy its obligation to issue Exercise Shares upon exercise of Warrants, the
full number of Exercise Shares deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding
Warrants.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company covenants that, upon payment of the applicable
exercise price by the holder, all Exercise Shares issued upon exercise of
Warrants will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
Stock.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Rights of Holder.</u> The holder of a Warrant will not,
by virtue of anything contained in this Warrant Agreement or otherwise, prior to
exercise of the Warrant, be entitled to any right whatsoever, either in law or
equity, of a stockholder of the Company, including without limitation, the right
to receive dividends or to vote or to consent or to receive notice as a
stockholder in respect of the meetings of stockholders or the election of
directors of the Company of any other matter.</p>

capital stock. After such allocation, that portion of the Exercise Price
applicable to each share of each such class of capital stock shall thereafter be
subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to the Exercise
Shares in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the allocation of the Exercise Price
between or among shares of capital stock as provided by this Section 7(a), a

the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger or transfer of assets which
reclassifies or changes its outstanding Common Stock, the successor corporation
(or corporation controlling the successor corporation or the Company, as the
case may be) shall by operation of law assume the Company's obligations under
this Agreement. Upon consummation of such transaction, the Warrants shall
automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash or
other assets which the holder of a Warrant would have owned immediately after
the consolidation, merger or transfer if the holder had exercised the Warrant
immediately before the effective date of such transaction. As a condition to the
consummation of such transaction, the Company shall arrange for the person or
entity obligated to issue securities or deliver cash or other assets upon
exercise of the Warrant to, concurrently with the consummation of such
transaction, assume the Company's obligations hereunder by executing an
instrument so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as

AMOUNT &nbsp;: ____________________________________<br>
DATE : ____________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities, I, the
Purchaser, represent to the Company the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition, and
have acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and
knowledgeable decision to acquire the Securities. I am purchasing these
Securities for my own account for investment purposes only and not with a view
to, or for the resale in connection with, any &quot;distribution&quot; thereof for
purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&quot;Securities Act&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of my investment intent
as expressed herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from
registration is otherwise available. In addition, I understand that the
certificate evidencing the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which
prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such
registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the Purchaser
satisfactory to the Company or receipt of a no-action letter from the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware of the provisions of Rule&nbsp;144, promulgated under the
Securities Act, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of
&quot;restricted securities&quot; acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer
thereof (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, if applicable, including, among other
things: the availability of certain public information about the Company; the
resale occurring not less than one year after the party has purchased and paid
for the securities to be sold; the sale being made through a broker in an
unsolicited &quot;broker's transaction&quot; or in transactions directly with a market
maker (as said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended); and the amount of securities being sold during any three month period
not exceeding the specified limitations stated therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that at the time I wish to sell the Securities there
may be no public market upon which to make such a sale, and that, even if such a
public market then exists, the Company may not be satisfying the current public
information requirements of Rule&nbsp;144, and that, in such event, I may be
precluded from selling the Securities under Rule&nbsp;144 even if the one-year
minimum holding period had been satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that in the event all of the requirements of
Rule&nbsp;144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance
with Regulation&nbsp;A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and
that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule&nbsp;144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the
SEC has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an
exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such
persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so
at their own risk.</p>

        SECURITY &nbsp;: COMMON STOCK<br>
AMOUNT &nbsp;: ____________________________________<br>
DATE : ____________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities, I, the
Purchaser, represent to the Company the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition, and
have acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and
knowledgeable decision to acquire the Securities. I am purchasing these
Securities for my own account for investment purposes only and not with a view
to, or for the resale in connection with, any &quot;distribution&quot; thereof for
purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&quot;Securities Act&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption
depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of my investment intent
as expressed herein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that the Securities must be held indefinitely unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from
registration is otherwise available. In addition, I understand that the
certificate evidencing the Securities will be imprinted with a legend which
prohibits the transfer of the Securities unless they are registered or such
registration is not required in the opinion of counsel for the Purchaser
satisfactory to the Company or receipt of a no-action letter from the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware of the provisions of Rule&nbsp;144, promulgated under the
Securities Act, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of
&quot;restricted securities&quot; acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer
thereof (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, if applicable, including, among other
things: the availability of certain public information about the Company; the
resale occurring not less than one year after the party has purchased and paid
for the securities to be sold; the sale being made through a broker in an
unsolicited &quot;broker's transaction&quot; or in transactions directly with a market
maker (as said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended); and the amount of securities being sold during any three month period
not exceeding the specified limitations stated therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that at the time I wish to sell the Securities there
may be no public market upon which to make such a sale, and that, even if such a
public market then exists, the Company may not be satisfying the current public
information requirements of Rule&nbsp;144, and that, in such event, I may be
precluded from selling the Securities under Rule&nbsp;144 even if the one-year
minimum holding period had been satisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I further understand that in the event all of the requirements of
Rule&nbsp;144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance
with Regulation&nbsp;A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and
that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule&nbsp;144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the
SEC has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an
exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such
persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so
at their own risk.</p>
