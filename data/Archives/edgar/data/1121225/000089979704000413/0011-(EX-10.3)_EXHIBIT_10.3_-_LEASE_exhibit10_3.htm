Waiver</u>.</b> Failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any
covenant or condition of this Lease in any one or more instances shall not be
construed as a waiver for the future of any such covenant or condition, but the
same shall be and remain in full force and effect. It is further specifically
agreed that in the event that at any time, or from time to time during the term,
a default shall exist under any of the provisions of this Lease, the payment by
Tenant to Landlord or the acceptance or receipt by Landlord from Tenant of any
one or more installments of rent while such default exists, shall not constitute
a waiver of such default and shall not alter, limit, or otherwise adversely
affect any of the rights of the Landlord or Tenant with respect to such default
including the right to terminate this Lease, and acceptance of such rental by
Landlord after termination shall not be deemed an election by Landlord waiving
such termination. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount
than the monthly rent herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on
account of the earliest stipulated rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement
of any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment, as rent be deemed
an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment

rental payments provided for herein. Tenant shall not share in any condemnation
award, but may recover for its relocation costs, if any such costs are awarded.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>

to the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust which may now be or hereafter may
be made a lien on the Leased Premises by Landlord or its assigns. Although no
instrument or act on the part of Tenant shall be necessary to effectuate such
subordination, Tenant will, nevertheless, execute such further instruments
subordinating the Lease to the lien of any such mortgage or deed of trust as may
be reasonably required by the lender, provided, however, and notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, that as long as the said Tenant, its
successors and assigns, shall fully perform the covenants and conditions
contained herein, including the payment of all rentals hereunder, it shall have
the right to peaceably occupy and possess the Leased Premises under this Lease

month-to-month tenancy thereby may be canceled at the end of any calendar month

<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to substitute the

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Events of Default / Remedies &amp; Damages / Waiver</u>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following shall constitute Events of Default:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event Tenant shall be in default in the

Tenant (a &quot;Payment&quot;) to Landlord under this Lease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event Tenant shall be in default in the
performance of any other covenants, terms, conditions, provisions, rules and
regulations of this Lease excepting those items listed in the above section (a)
above (a &quot;Non-Monetary Default&quot;) and if such Non-Monetary Default is not cured
within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof given by Landlord,
excepting such Non-Monetary Default that cannot be cured completely within such
twenty (20) day period providing Tenant, within such twenty (20) day period, has
promptly commenced to proceed with diligence and in good faith to remedy such
Non-Monetary Default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Remedies and Damages</p>
</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any Event of Default occurs, Landlord
individually and/or by and through its agent (Duke, Holzman, Yaeger &amp; Photiadis
LLP) may, at its option and in addition to any and all other rights or remedies
provided Landlord in this Lease or at law or equity, immediately, or at any time
thereafter, and without demand or notice (except as provided herein):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without waiving the Event of Default, apply all or
part of the security deposit, if any, to cure the Event of Default and Tenant
shall on demand restore the security deposit to its original amount;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without waiving such Event of Default, apply thereto
any overpayment of rents to curing the Event of Default in lieu of refunding or
crediting the same to Tenant;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Event of Default pertains to work or other
obligations (other than the payment of rent or additional rent) to be performed
by Tenant, without waiving such Event of Default, enter upon the Leased Premises
and perform such work or other obligation, or cause such work or other
obligation to be performed, for the account of Tenant; and Tenant shall on
demand pay to Landlord the cost of performing such work or other obligation plus
five percent (5%) thereof as administrative costs;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; issue a written notice declaring Tenant in monetary
default for nonpayment of fixed rent, additional rent and/or late charges and
providing Tenant with seven (7) days from the issuance of said written notice to
cure all monetary default(s). In the event all monetary defaults are not cured
within the seven (7) day cure period, Landlord may </p>
<p align="center">2</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>issue a written notice stating that the term of this Lease will expire on a
date at least five (5) days thereafter, in which case the term of this Lease
shall automatically expire on the date so fixed in such notice as fully and
completely as if it were the date herein definitely fixed for the expiration of
the term, and all right, title and interest of the Tenant hereunder shall
thereupon cease and expire, and the Tenant shall thereupon quit and surrender
the Leased Premises to Landlord, it being the intention of the parties hereto to
create hereby a conditional limitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any termination of this Lease or
termination of Tenant's rights to possession, Tenant shall pay and be liable for
(on the days fixed herein for the payment thereof) the several installments of
rent and additional rent as and when due, as if this Lease had not been
terminated and as if Landlord had not entered and whether the Leased Premises
are relet or remain vacant in whole or in part, but in the event the Leased
Premises are relet by Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit in the net
sum of rent and additional rent received by the Landlord in reletting after
deduction of all expenses (other than fit out or remodeling) incurred in
reletting the Leased Premises, and in collecting such rents and additional rent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a reletting, Landlord may apply
the rent therefrom first to the payment of Landlord's reasonable expenses
including but not limited to attorney's fees incurred, reasonable expense of
reletting, repairs, brokerage fees, subdividing and then to the payment of rent
and all other sums due from Tenant hereunder, and Tenant shall remain liable for
any deficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Waiver of Rights of Redemption</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights of redemption granted by or
under any present or future laws in the event of Tenant's being evicted or
dispossessed for any cause, or in the event of Landlord's obtaining possession
of the Leased Premises by reason of the violation, by Tenant, of any of the
covenants or conditions of this Lease, or otherwise.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to substitute the
following for Section 30 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Holding Over</u>. </b>Landlord shall give Tenant at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice if Landlord shall expect or demand that Tenant vacate the Leased
Premises upon the expiration of the term of this Lease or any renewal thereof,
except under circumstances wherein Landlord terminates the Lease pursuant
paragraph 26 of this Lease in which case the thirty (30) day notice provided for
under this paragraph 30 shall not be required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Tenant should continue to
occupy the Leased Premises without having exercised its option to renew (if any)
or without an Agreement in writing as to the terms of such continued possession,
then such additional tenancy shall be on a month-to-month basis at 150% of the
previous existing rental and under the same terms and conditions as provided in
this Lease or the renewal thereof. In case of such continued possession, the
month-to-month tenancy thereby may be canceled at the end of any calendar month
by not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice from either party.</p>
<p align="center">3</p>
<P style=PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:always>
<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to substitute the
following for Section 31 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Notices</u>. </b>Any notice to Landlord provided for herein shall be deemed to
have been served only when such notice in writing addressed to Landlord, or to
the party to whom rent was last paid, has been deposited in a regular receptacle
of the U.S. Postal Service by registered or certified mail, addressed to the
address hereinabove set forth. Any notice to Tenant as provided for herein, may
be issued by Landlord and/or its agent (Duke, Holzman, Yaeger &amp; Photiadis LLP)
and shall be deemed to have been served only when such notice in writing has
been deposited in a regular receptacle of the U.S. Postal Service by registered
or certified mail addressed to Tenant at the Leased Premises.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lease is hereby amended to add the following
as Section 39 in its entirety:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>
Legal Fees</u>. </b>Tenant agrees to pay all fees, including reasonable
attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by Landlord in connection with the
enforcement of any provision of this Lease, including those incurred in
connection with any summary proceeding seeking the removal of Tenant from the
Leased Premises.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneously with the execution of this
Amendment, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord certified funds totaling $77,000.00
($54,156.35 of which are currently being held in escrow) representing (i) the
fixed rents due and owing to date, (ii) the additional rents due and owing to
date, (iii) the late charges due and owing to date, and (iv) Landlord's legal
fees incurred as a result of Tenant's defaults. Because this document is being
executed subsequent to December 1, 2003, the parties agree that the bi-monthly
fixed rent payment in the amount of $32,330.00 covering the period of
January-February 2004 will be due and payable on January 1, 2003. All bi-monthly
fixed rent payments thereafter will be made in accordance Section 5 of the Lease
Amendment as provided herein.</p>
<p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties hereby ratify, adopt and confirm that
the Lease (as amended hereby) continues in full force and effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment
has been executed by the parties as of the date set forth above even though, for
the convenience of the parties, it may be executed by either or both of them on
some other date or dates.</p>
