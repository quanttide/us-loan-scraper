Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

General; Structure of Acquisition

      On December 20, 2004, Chardan China Acquisition Corp. ("CCAC") entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") with State Harvest
Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation ("Origin"), and all the
stockholders of Origin ("Origin stockholders") for CCAC's acquisition of Origin.
Origin is a BVI holding company formed for the purpose of owning, as of the
closing, four Chinese companies engaged in the production and sale of
agricultural corn, cotton and rice seeds. The operating companies are Beijing
Origin Seed Limited, Changchun Origin Seed Technical Development Limited and
Henan Origin Cotton Technology Development Limited (these three companies are
referred to as the "Chinese Operating Subsidiaries"), and the technology -
intellectual property holding and licensing company is Beiging Origin State
Harvest Biotechnology Limited ("Origin Biotechnology").

      For the acquisition, CCAC will form its own wholly-owned subsidiary under
the laws of the British Virgin Islands, under the name Origin Agritech Limited
("Agritech"), and at the time of the closing, CCAC will merge with and into
Agritech for the purpose of redomestication out of the United States to secure
future tax benefits. This redomestication merger will be achieved by a
one-for-one exchange of all the outstanding common stock of CCAC for common
stock of Agritech and the assumption of all the rights and obligations of CCAC
by Agritech, including assumption of the outstanding warrants of CCAC on the
same terms as they currently exist. Then, Agritech immediately will acquire all
the common stock of Origin by the issuance of shares and payment of cash
consideration as described below, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.
Additionally, at the closing, the Chinese parties to the Purchase Agreement will
execute various stock consignment agreements assigning to Origin their rights in
the Chinese Operating Subsidiaries so that they will become the equivalent of
subsidiaries of Origin under Chinese law. Beijing Origin Seed Limited will be
97.96% owned with Henan Agriculture University holding the remaining 2.04%,
Henan Origin Cotton Technology Development Limited will be 97.96% owned with the
remaining 2.04% owned by an individual, and Changchun Origin Seed Technical
Development Limited and Origin Biotechnology will be 100% owned. The three
Chinese Operating Companies will also execute Technology Service Agreements with
Origin Biotechnology for the assignment, holding and management of the
technology and intellectual property of the seeds and their production.

      The current management of Origin and the Chinese Subsidiaries, led by Dr.
Han Gengchen and Messrs. Yang Yasheng and Yuan Liang, will become the executive
officers of Agritech and will continue to operate the Chinese companies. These
persons will also become three of the nine-person board of directors of
Agritech. Kerry Propper, a current director and an officer of CCAC, also will be
a director of Agritech. Dr. Han and Messrs Yang and Yuan will enter into a
voting agreement with Agritech and Mr. Propper for their commitment to take such
action as is necessary to nominate and elect Mr. Propper and a designee of his
as directors of Agritech for three years after the closing. Of the remaining
four director positions two will be filled upon the recommendation the Chinese
parties and two will be jointly determined, but consideration will be made in
meeting the requirements of having directors who are both independent and
financially sophisticated.


                                       2
<PAGE>

      The transaction is expected to be consummated in the second fiscal quarter
of 2005, after the required approval by CCAC stockholders, as discussed herein.

Purchase Price

      At the closing, the Origin stockholders and their designees, subject to
adjustments and certain holdbacks, will be paid an aggregate of $10,000,000 in
cash and issued an aggregate of 10,200,000 shares of Agritech common stock for
all the outstanding common stock of Origin. Of the cash portion of the purchase
price, $250,000 will be held back for one year by Agritech to secure certain
indemnification obligations of the Origin stockholders.

      As additional purchase price, Agritech will pay to the Origin stockholders
and their designees, up to an aggregate of $15,000,000 in the event that any of
the following occurs during any fiscal year of Agritech after the closing date
until December 31, 2008 (or June 30, 2009 if the fiscal year is changed to a
July 1 - June 30 fiscal year):

      A. If Agritech receives at least $40,000,000 in gross proceeds in
additional financing (i) as a result of the call of the outstanding public
warrants assumed by Agritech at the closing; (ii) upon Agritech's successful
completion of a secondary offering; or (iii) the private investment into
Agritech by a strategic investor ("Financing Adjustment"); or

      B. If Agritech generates a net positive cash flow of not less than
$2,000,000 on a consolidated basis in any fiscal year after the closing
("Earnings Adjustment"), the Origin stockholders and their designees will be
entitled to receive 75% of the net positive cash flow up to a maximum of
$7,500,000 per fiscal year; provided however, that the board of directors of the
surviving corporation, solely on the basis of a proposal by Dr. Han, as a
director, may reduce the amount to be paid in any one year.

      In the event that both an Earnings Adjustment and a Financing Adjustment
occurs, the maximum aggregate amount to be paid to the Origin stockholders from
one or both adjustments is $15,000,000.

      As further additional purchase price, certain Origin stockholders and
their designees will be issued, on an all or none basis per year, an aggregate
of 1,500,000 shares of common stock of Agritech, if on a consolidated basis,
Agritech has or exceeds after-tax profits (excluding after-tax operating profits
from any subsequent acquisition for securities that have a dilutive effect and
before the expenses of this transaction and director and employee option
expense) in the following amounts for the indicated 12-month periods ending June
30:

                 Year ending June 30,                After Tax Profit
                 --------------------                ----------------
                        2006                           $11,000,000
                        2007                           $16,000,000
                        2008                           $21,000,000
                        2009                           $29,000,000

CCAC, at a meeting called for these purposes, (i) approving the Purchase

Agritech for the purpose of corporate redomestication in the BVI, which will
include retention of the Agritech name and an increase in the authorized capital

stockholders will also be asked to adopt a stock option and award plan, but the

voted. Additionally, if holders owning 20% or more of the Public Shares vote
against the transaction and exercise their right to convert their Public Shares
into a pro-rata portion of the funds held in trust by CCAC, then the transaction
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement cannot be approved. The approval of the
redomestication and corresponding differences in the charters of CCAC and
Agritech will require a vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock of
CCAC. The approval of the stock plan will require the approval of the majority
of the holders of CCAC common stock present at the meeting. The directors are
elected by a plurality of the shares of common stock of CCAC outstanding.

stay, judgment or decree issued by any governmental authority preventing,
restraining or prohibiting in whole or in part, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement, (ii) execution and delivery
to each party of each of the various transaction documents, (iii) delivery by
each party to the other party of a certificate to the effect that the
representations and warranties of each party are true and correct in all

            the Origin subsidiaries or its business from that shown or reflected
            in the financial statements of Origin at September 30, 2004 and as
            to be described in the CCAC proxy statement, and between the date of
            the Purchase Agreement and the closing date, there shall not have
            occurred an event which, in the reasonable opinion of CCAC would
            have a material adverse effect on Origin or the subsidiaries of
            Origin;

      (iv)  At the closing, Origin and the Origin subsidiaries, on a
            consolidated basis immediately prior to closing, will have not less
            than US $10,000,000 in cash assets and will have short and long term
            debt only to the extent arising in the ordinary course of business;

      (v)   The information about Origin and its subsidiaries and its management
            provided for inclusion in the CCAC proxy statement at the time of
            its distribution and at the closing, will accurately reflect the
            business, Origin, the


                                       6

            voting authority in favor of Kerry Propper and one of Mr. Propper's
            designees as directors of Agritech for a period of three years after
            the closing.

Indemnification

      The Origin Stockholders shall indemnify and hold harmless Agritech for any
damages, whether as a result of any third party claim or otherwise, and which
arise from or in connection with the breach of representations and warranties
and agreements and covenants of Origin, the Origin subsidiaries or the Origin
Stockholders. Agritech shall indemnify and hold harmless each Origin stockholder
from and against and shall reimburse each Origin stockholder for any damages,
whether as a result of any third party claim or otherwise, and which arise from
or in connection with the breach of representations and warranties and
agreements and covenants of CCAC, which will be assumed by Agritech upon the
redomestication merger. Claims may be asserted once the damages exceed $50,000.
Any indemnification payments shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the purchase
price. There will be withheld $250,000 from the initial payment of $10,000,000
to be paid to the Origin Stockholders at the closing, for a period of 12 months,
to be available to satisfy, in whole or part, any claim under the
indemnification obligations of the Origin Stockholders.

      The determination to assert a claim for indemnification against the Origin
stockholders for the benefit of Agritech will be determined by an independent
committee of the board of directors of Agritech. The independent committee of
the board of directors will consist of two persons, as selected by the board of
directors, none of whom is an officer or employee of Agritech and its
subsidiaries or is the direct or beneficial owner of 5% or more of the voting
capital stock of Agritech.

Termination

      The Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time, but not later than
the closing as follows:

      (i)   By mutual written consent of CCAC and Origin;


                                       7
<PAGE>

      (ii)  By either party if the other party amends a schedule and such
            amendment or supplement reflects a material adverse change in the
            condition, operations or prospects of its business; (iii) By either
            party if the closing has not occurred by May 31, 2005 (unless such
            terminating party is in breach of any of its material covenants,
            representations or warranties);

      (iv)  By either party if the other party has breached any of its covenants
            or representations and warranties in any material respect and has
            not cured its breach within 10 business days of the notice of an
            intent to terminate, provided that the terminating party is itself
            not in breach;

      (v)   By Origin, if the board of directors of CCAC (or any committee
            thereof) shall have failed to recommend or withdraw or modify in a
            manner adverse to Origin its approval or recommendation of the
            Purchase Agreement and any of the transactions contemplated thereby;

      (vi)  By CCAC if its board of directors shall have determined in good
            faith, based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure
            to terminate the Purchase Agreement is reasonably likely to result
            in the board of directors breaching its fiduciary duties to
            stockholders by reason of the pendency of an unsolicited, bona fide
            written proposal for a superior transaction; or

      (vii) By either party if, at the CCAC stockholder meeting, the Purchase
            Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby shall fail to be
            approved and adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of
            CCAC's common stock, or 20% or more of the Public Shares request
            conversion of their shares into the pro rata portion of the trust
            fund in accordance with the CCAC certificate of incorporation.

      If the Purchase Agreement is terminated by CCAC for material breach of a
covenant, representation or warranty or material amendment to a schedule of
Origin, the Origin subsidiaries or Origin stockholders, then the Origin
stockholders will pay CCAC $1,000,000 upon termination of the Purchase Agreement
in lieu of any other right or remedy that the CCAC may have against the other
parties to the Purchase Agreement for such breach. If the Purchase Agreement is
terminated by Origin for a material breach of a covenant, representation or
warranty or material amendment to a schedule of CCAC, or because the board of
directors of CCAC fails to recommend or withdraws or modifies its approval or
recommendation of approval of the Purchase Agreement, then Richard Propper,
Kerry Propper, Jiangnan Huang, Li Zhang, Dan Beharry and Steven Urback (pro rata
in relation to their initial ownership in CCAC) will pay Origin $1,000,000 upon
termination of the Purchase Agreement in lieu of any other right or remedy that
Origin may have against the other parties to the Purchase Agreement for such
breach. The Origin entities have no right to damages from CCAC or Agritech and
they have no right to any amount held in the trust fund, and they have agreed
not to make any claim against CCAC and Agritech that would adversely affect the
business, operations or prospects of CCAC and Agritech or the amount of the
funds held in the trust fund.

Employment Agreements

      Each of Dr. Han Gengchen and Messrs. Yuan Liang and Yung Yasheng will
enter into a three-year employment agreement with Origin. Dr. Han will be
employed as the chief executive officer, Mr. Yuan will be the executive vice
chairman and Mr. Yang will be president and chief operating officer. The
agreements will provide for an annual salary of $250,000 and a discretionary
cash bonus based on growth in CCAC's per-share value, achievement of growth and
business targets, satisfaction of company capital requirements and other
criteria, as the compensation committee determines. The executives will be
entitled to insurance benefits, five weeks vacation, a car and reimbursement of
business expenses and, if necessary, relocation expenses. The agreements will be
terminable by Origin for death, disability and cause. The executive may
terminate for good reason, which includes CCAC's breach, the executive not being
a member of the board of directors, and change of control. In the event of
termination for good reason, the executive will receive two years compensation
and benefits. The agreements contain provisions for the protection of
confidential information and a three-year-after employment non-competition
period within the PRC. In the Purchase Agreement, there is an additional
non-competition agreement applicable to these persons for the greater of five
years after consummation or two years after employment that includes Hong Kong
and Taiwan, in addition to the PRC.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

Overview of Origin

      Origin is one of the premier players in China's seed industry. It
specializes in the research, development, production, sale and distribution of
agricultural crop seeds. Origin's primary concentration is on hybrid corn seed,
but it is in the process of expanding into the development and sale of
cottonseed and hybrid rice seed.

      Origin was founded in December 1997, with headquarters in Beijing.
Currently, Origin has over four hundred employees. It has four subsidiaries, one
of which is a technology holding corporation to hold and manage its intellectual
property. Origin operates through several branches in locations in Beijing,
Hebei, Gansu, Henan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Sichuan. As Origin expands, it plans
to locate additional production facilities, sales offices and research stations
strategically throughout China in the main corn, cotton, and rice agricultural
belts.

Leading Market Position

      Although Origin has only a six-year history in the Chinese seed industry,
many of its business practices have become benchmarks for other Chinese seed
companies. Origin's executives have global business experience and access to
global resources through their previous industry, educational and research ties.
Origin employs a team of internationally educated and experienced managers and
researchers. Its in-house research and development team is one of the most
efficient in the Chinese corn seed industry and has already developed many of
its own hybrid lines and established a rich product development pipeline.


                                       9
<PAGE>

      Origin is recognized for the quality of its hybrid corn seeds and
efficient sales network. As a result of these factors and its 24/7 service, its
seeds command a premium price in the seed market. Origin believes that it
currently has the largest processing capability, largest company-run seed
production base and most advanced equipment in the Chinese seed industry.
Furthermore, it is the only Chinese seed company that provides post-sale
technical service, which serves to bolster its relationship with its customer
base.

      The seed industry in China has significant time and expense barriers to
entry. It generally takes between eight and ten years to develop and sell
proprietary hybrid seeds in China. First, prior to initiating government
licensing and testing procedures, a company seeking to sell seed must develop
environment specific hybrid products appropriate for a given regional market, a
process that can last as long as four to six years. Second, the company must be
granted two licenses, a process which takes at least one year. Third, the
company must submit seeds for government testing, which lasts at least three
years, and then it must wait until the following growing season to begin sales.
Once this process is completed, a new company must build brand recognition and a
sales and service network in order to reach the market.

Origin Represents a Consolidation Opportunity in a Fragmented Market

      The vast majority of the global hybrid seed market is controlled by
Monsanto, Pioneer and Sygenta; however, there is no market leader in China at
this time. The Chinese seed market is extremely fragmented, and the top five
companies control less than 25% of the market. In 2003, Origin had approximately
a 3% market share and in the first nine months of 2004, Origin had a 3.75%
market share, and it is among these top five companies. The remaining 75% of the
Chinese market is spread among approximately 5,000 local seed producers that
sell only to local farmers. These companies, in general, are poorly run and have
no motivation to expand geographically. Their product is generally neither
uniform nor up to international standards. Origin believes that, in the future,
it is likely that these companies will discontinue seed production and become
distributors for one of the larger, better capitalized and quality oriented seed
companies, like Origin.

Origin Has Seasoned Management Team

      The Chairman and CEO, Dr. Han, received his PhD in Plant Breeding and
Cytogenetics from Iowa State University and has over twenty years experience in
the seed industry. He worked for the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico from 1987 to 1990, and Pioneer Hi-bred International
Inc., in the Philippines and Taiwan, from 1990 to 1996. Dr. Han's concentration
is in the research and development of corn seed and general management of the
Origin seed business.

      The President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Yang, has over fifteen
years of experience in marketing and selling corn products in China. He studied
molecular biology at the University of Maryland in the US, and served as an
officer in the Fujian provincial government where he specialized in the areas of
technology, medicine and education. Since Mr. Yang joined Origin sales revenues
have increased rapidly, from RMB28MM (US$3.5 million) in 1998 to nearly RMB300MM
(US$38 million) in 2003.

      The company's executive vice chairman is Mr. Yuan, who has been with the
company since 1997. Mr. Yuan received his Bachelor and Master degrees in
Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. One of the other
companies with which Mr. Yuan is affiliated as a director with Fujian
Co-development Company, which is listed on the Hong Kong exchange.

      Origin currently has 32 research and development specialists, 142 sales
people, 59 administrative staff, and 183 technicians in the production plants.

Production of the High Quality Hybrid Seeds

      Origin believes that it maintains the strictest seed quality control
system in China. It was the first Chinese seed company to gain ISO9001-2000
certification. To continue its position as a quality producer, the company
consistently expends approximately5% of its gross income resources on research
and development. Also, the company established its own stable of seed production
bases in Gansu and Inner Mongolia by providing seed-producing farmers with
technical training and strict field quality control practices. Origin believes
that it has the largest processing capability and utilizes the most advanced
equipment in China, which helps to guarantee a high quality of hybrid seeds. By
employing these practices, Origin believes that it has achieved a product
quality on par with, if not superior to, that of its foreign counterparts.

      Origin has very close relationships with the top academic research
institutions in China, including the Chinese Academy of Science, China
Agricultural Academy of Science, Beijing Agricultural Academy of Science, Henan
Agricultural University and Liaoning Agricultural Academy. Origin has cooperated
with these institutions through contractual research, partnering relationships
and by joint-licensing various varieties of their hybrid seeds. One of Origin's
subsidiaries is 2.04% owned by Henan University.

      The development of the science of genetics has permitted the creation of
new species of corn, rice and cotton, rather than just new varieties.
Genetically modified (GM) corn, soybean and cotton have been widely used in the
United States and many other countries to guard against insect damage and to
increase yields. The future potential for GM corn and rice in China is
astounding. Since receiving Chinese government approval, GM cotton is now
planted by nearly 70% of Chinese cotton farmers to guard against bore damage.
Because the Chinese market has widely accepted GM cotton, and the Ministry of
Agriculture is beginning to promote GM rice seed, Origin believes that GM
products will eventually be fully promoted and accepted in the Chinese market.

      In response to these developments, Origin initiated its own biotech
program in 2000, and it is cooperating with the Chinese Academy of Science,
China Agricultural University, China Agricultural Academy of Science and Beijing
Agricultural Academy of Science on gene research. Origin's strategy is to ensure
that the technology will be ready when the market is ready.

National Marketing and Distributors

      Origin has its own sales organization of 142 persons that oversee all
aspects of the distribution and retail sale network and promote the company
sales to the expanding distribution chain.

      Origin has established a stable, nationwide distribution network with over
1,200 first-level distributors and over 20,000 second-level distributors and
some retailers. The distributors in turn sell to the retailers and retailers
sell to the farmers, of which there are over 200 million end-user corn farmers
in China. This distribution network covers almost all the provinces of China,
excluding only Qinghai and Tibet. The top five provinces in terms of sales
volume are Jilin, Sichuan, Liaoning, Chongqin and Hunan, representing 42.51% of
Origin's 2003 annual sales volume.

      Generally, there is only one distributor responsible for all sales of
Origin products in a specific county on an exclusive basis. In order to enforce
exclusivity and monitor product locations, Origin assigns a code to each
distributor and marks all packaging sent to the distributor with this code.
Vigilant monitoring of territory integrity and enforcement of penalties, which
may include termination of distribution rights, provides stability and
profitability within the distribution network, ensuring quality services and
product availability to the end customers. Origin enjoys a very positive
reputation for its implementation and enforcement of this exclusive distribution
system.

      All distributors' orders must be paid in full prior to delivery. Advance
deposit orders account for between 70% and 80% of Origin's sales; the remaining
20 % to 30% are comprised of spot transactions. Distributors are able to obtain
discounts by advance deposit during the months of August, September and October.
At the end of the annual sales season, Origin sets a final sales price that is
below the suggested retail price. Those distributors who have taken delivery of
product prior to the set price are refunded the difference, if any, though many
elect to have Origin retain a portion to count toward their advance deposit for
the following year.

      Origin maintains very close relationships with its distributors. A
distributor, once certified, receives many value-added services such as
management training, sales technical training, marketing information and
technical support. After-sales service also includes "zero risk storage
management" for the distributors. This program guarantees that distributors that
have an overstock of Origin seed will be relieved of their surplus by the
company's repurchase program. Sales representatives re-allocate surplus
inventory to other areas of demand. This service speeds-up distributors'
clearance of stock and reduces both inventory risk and carrying costs. In
addition to the positive impact on the distribution network and the increased
assurance that product availability is commensurate with demand, the zero
overstock program helps insure that end-user seed is of the highest quality and
within the company-specified shelf life.

      On an annual basis, Origin's sales team assists distributors in writing
monthly sales plans. These sales plans are then submitted to Origin via
facsimile 30 days prior to required seed delivery dates. Every year around the
harvest season, Origin organizes corn production demonstrations in cooperation
with local villages and seed distributors, to which are invited


                                       12
<PAGE>

farmers and others in the seed distribution chain. At these demonstrations,
Origin teams show their hybrid corn, explain planting techniques, discuss
industry best practices and disseminate promotional materials. These marketing
and production demonstrations help create new demand, not only in each village
where demonstrations are held, but also in nearby villages, for both the current
season and for succeeding years.

      The technical department of the company has a 24-hour toll-free number
available for farmers and distributors, through which they can obtain solutions
to specific technical problems and issues of seed piracy. If on-site help is
required, a Technical Assistant will arrive on location within 48 hours of a
call. Origin also enlists the help of its distributors to provide help and
advice to the farmer. As a result, Origin provides an unique level of service in
China which builds brand identity and loyalty and has resulted in improving
sales.

      Using local TV and radio broadcasts, Origin promotes its brand to over 70%
of its geographic market, reaching over fourteen million individual farmer
households. Additionally, Origin publishes a seasonal newspaper, "Origin News,"
with a distribution to about twenty million farmers in which it addresses
technical issues, shares success stories and further promotes the Origin brand.
Origin News is the de facto source of product and technical information for the
Chinese peasant farmer. Origin maintains a database of over 1,000,000 farmers
that tracks buying habits and contact information.

      Product and technical service brochures are provided throughout the
distribution network and prove a valuable tool in promoting the sale of the corn
seed product and the recognition of the Origin brand. The Origin slogan, "When
buying seed, quality is paramount -- trust Origin," appears on all promotional
material, helping to build the brand in all the local markets.

Strong Intellectual Property Portfolio

      One of the strengths of Origin is its portfolio of intellectual property.
The most important of which is the portfolio of seed hybrids and varieties. In
addition it has various copyright and trademarks.

      Origin launched its first proprietary product in 2003 after six years of
research and development. In 2004, Origin delivered four new proprietary
products to the market. With its research, breeding system and management,
Origin has been able to introduce forty to fifty new proprietary products into
the government testing and approval cycle each year in the past and anticipates
continuing to do so at this pace. If Origin is successful in maintaining this
flow of new products, this should result in at least three new products being
approved and available for the market each succeeding year. Currently Origin has
seven products in the third and last year of the testing and approval cycle,
sixteen products in the second and twenty-three products in the first. These
currently ensure new hybrid seeds will be available for release to the market
each year over the next several years.

      Origin has brought to market twenty-one new varieties of hybrid seed in
2004, including eighteen varieties of corn and three varieties of cottonseed. Of
these varieties, four hybrid corn seeds and one hybrid cottonseed were developed
by Origin's research and development team,


                                       13
<PAGE>

while the remaining sixteen seed products were licensed from independent
research and development institutions, which have no commercialization ability
or distribution channels. All licenses are exclusive to Origin with the
exception of one seed product, Yuyu22. License fees paid to research institutes
are approximately 5% of the wholesale price, and are normally negotiated against
total annual sales volume per seed product.

      Seed counterfeiting is widespread in China. In response to this serious
problem, Origin has devised a user-friendly solution to protect the customer and
its seed brands. Origin places a unique identifying code on each bag of seed
that it sells. Farmers can call the technical support line to verify the code,
ensuring the seed is a genuine Origin product. Operators note each time a code
is verified, negating the possibility of a counterfeiter repeatedly using the
same number. Origin receives as many as 6,000 phone calls per day for technical
assistance and code verification.

      Origin has also sought and achieved court protection of is branded seeds.
In a recent action against 14 counterfeiters, the first tribunal level ordered a
cease and desist of infringement of the company seeds and awarded damages. The
case has been appealed on the issue of the damages. This case is unique in China
at this time and has demonstrated the widespread support for protecting seed
production. Origin expects this to have an important impact over the long term
in protecting its rights and brand identity.

Future Strategy: Entering the Cottonseed and Rice Seed Markets

      China is the largest producer and consumer of cotton in the world. Demand
for cottonseed in China is approximately 100 million KGs, or about 3 billion RMB
(US$375 million) annually. In China, rice is planted mainly for human
consumption. There are about 30 million hectares in use for planting rice in the
country. Demand for rice seed is about 600 million KGs, or about 6 billion RMB
(US$750 million) annually. Since the business models for corn, cotton and rice
production are very similar, and share similar sales channels, part of Origin's
strategic plan is to participate in the cotton and rice seed business.

      Since its inception in 1998, Origin has been working to develop its own
hybrid cottonseed. Currently, it has two cotton products in government testing
programs. After its success with corn seed sales in the Southwest of China (a
primary agricultural area for rice), Origin decided to enter the rice business
by taking advantage of its existing sales channels and corporate brand image. To
facilitate a quick start to this program, Origin will license a hybrid rice seed
from a partner research institute for resale by the end of this year. In
addition, Origin plans to produce and sell hybrid rice seed by the end of the
next growing season.

      Origin also plans, when possible, to acquire some of the smaller
distribution channels, to consolidate its position in the market and strengthen
its presence and increase its market share.
