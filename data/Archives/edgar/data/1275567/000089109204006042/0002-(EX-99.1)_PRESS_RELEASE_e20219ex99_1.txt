December ____, 2004


Origin is one of the  fastest  growing and most  profitable  seed  companies  in
China.  Under the current  management team its annual revenues and earnings grew
over the prior year at a compounded rate of 59% and 188%,  respectively for 2002
and 2003.  Since its  inception  six years ago,  with an investment of less than
$400,000,  Origin has been  capitalized and grown entirely from the redeployment
of its  earnings.  This  year,  Origin is the only  agricultural  company on the
Deloitte  Touche  Tohmatsu  list of the fastest  growing  companies  in the Asia
Pacific Region.

Origin  specializes  in  the  research,   development,   production,   sale  and
distribution  of hybrid  agricultural  crop seeds.  Its primary  focus is on the
development and sale of corn seeds, which account for over 95% of its sales this
year. It has just recently introduced entries in the cotton seed and hybrid rice
markets,  which currently account for the remainder.  The Company is headquarted
in Beijing,  China with  subsidiaries  and branches  located in Beijing,  Hebei,
Gansu, Henan,  Liaoning,  Jilin and Sichuan.  Origin has more than 400 employees
throughout these locations.

US GAAP audited  revenues for the first nine months of 2004 were US $25,726,468.
Net income for the first nine months of 2004 was US $4,604,386. Revenues for the
year ended December 31st 2003 were US  $23,155,370,  up from US $11,927,421  for
the year  ended  December  31st  2002.  Net  income  for the year ended 2003 was
$3,498,001.

As of September 30, 2004, cash and cash equivalents were US $4,589,805,  working
capital was US $4,874,759  and the current ratio was 1.4:1.  It is expected that
Origin's  total  assets and net  assets  will  increase  in the  quarter  ending
December 31, 2004, due to a variety of factors related to the seasonality of its
business.

The audited  financial  statements of Origin,  based on US GAAP, are included in
this  release,  and include the balance  sheets for the year ended  December 31,
2003 and the nine month period ended  September 30, 2004,  and the statements of
operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, and for the years
ended December 31, of 2001, 2002, and 2003.

Origin is led by a seasoned  management team.  Chairman and CEO Dr. Gengchen Han
received his Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Cytogenetics from Iowa State University
and has over 20 years of seed  industry  experience.  He  previously  worked for
Pioneer  Hi-bred  International  (1990-1996) and  International  Maize and Wheat
Improvement  Center in Mexico  (1987-1990).  Chief Operating Officer Yashen Yang
graduated  from the  University of Maryland with a degree in molecular  biology,
and served as an officer in the Fujian provincial  government.  He has more than
15 years of  experience  in  marketing  and  selling  corn  products  in  China.
Executive  vice chairman Liang Yuan received his BS and MA degrees in Mechanical
Engineering  from Shanghai Jiao Tong  University.  Mr Yuan is also a director of
Fujian Co-development  Company, which is listed on the Hong Kong Exchange.  Upon
consummation  of the  transactions,  these  presons  will  continue  to lead the
company and will be the management of the public company.

Chardan, based in San Diego,  California,  was incorporated in December 2003, to
acquire an operating  business  having its primary  operating  facilities in the
People's Republic of China.  Chardan  consummated its initial public offering on
March 22,  2004,  receiving  net proceeds of $21.2  million  through the sale of
4.025 million  units at $6.00 per unit.  Each unit was comprised of one share of
Chardan common stock and two redeemable  and  convertible  common stock purchase
warrants having an exercise price of $5.00.  Chardan holds over $20.5 million of
the  net  proceeds  of  that  offering  in a  trust  account  maintained  by  an
independent trustee which will be released upon the consummation of the business
combination.

Dr. Richard Propper,  Chairman of Chardan,  commented, "We are extremely pleased
that Chardan will be able to consummate an  acquisition of a company of Origin's
high caliber. The company is profitable,  cash flow positive and is in the early
stages  of its  growth  cycle.  In  addition,  its  internationally  experienced
management team has approached the business from a uniquely global  perspective,
executing on a strategy that we believe will continue to  significantly  enhance
shareholder  value. On a historical  basis Origin has had substantial  earnings,
and it has already received  deposits for approximately 80% of its expected seed
sales for the 2005 growing season."

Dr. Propper continued, "To put the business of Origin in context,  approximately
75% of China's 1.3 billion citizens are farmers. In a highly fragmented industry
in which the top five  companies  control  less than 15% of the corn seed market
and in which there are over 5000 participants,  Origin has garnered about a 4.5%
market share in 2004. Origin has significant  opportunity for growth in the corn
seed market since the majority of the Company's  competitors  are state-owned or
family  owned  and  operated  businesses  that do not have  the same  vertically
integrated  (R&D,  sales,  distribution)  model.  Despite  the fact  that  large
multinationals  have been  active in this  market for more than a decade  longer
than Origin,  they  aggregately  account for less than 1% of the total corn seed
market in the  aggregate.  Even  though  Origin  only has a  six-year  operating
history, many of its business practices have become benchmarks for other Chinese
seed companies. "

Dr. Propper concluded, "From an industry perspective, the high barriers to entry
are  appealing.  Today,  it  probably  would  take up to eight  years  for a new
competitor  to develop and sell  proprietary  hybrid seeds in China.  We believe
that  Origin's  in-house  R&D team is the most  efficient  in the  Chinese  seed
industry.  Origin  successfully passed registration trials for six of its hybrid
seeds in 2003 and for another six in 2004.  In  addition,  37 other  hybrids are
currently in various stages of official trials.  Origin consistently  devotes 5%
of its revenues to R&D, which has resulted in an impressive development pipeline
and  proprietary  product  portfolio.  Over  Origin's  six year  history,  while
developing a strong  portfolio of proprietary  hybrid seeds,  it  simultaneously
developed brand recognition,  consumer trust, and a nationwide sales and service
infrastructure that is unparalleled in the Chinese seed market.  Origin has also
established  rigorous  controls to protect its intellectual  property rights. In
fact,  the  Company   recently  won  the  first  case  in  China  in  which  DNA
fingerprinting  was used to prove that a  competing  company  was  stealing  and
reselling Origin hybrid seed.

Approximately 60,000 farmers,  localized in two provinces,  produce 18 different
types of hybrid seeds for Origin.  This seed, once processed and bagged, will be
sold to over 10,000,000 Chinese farmers in 2005. The Company has more than 1,200
first-level  distributors  and 20,000  second-level  distributors  and retailers
covering all but three Chinese provinces. Additionally, as the only Chinese seed
company offering 24/7 post-sale  technical service,  Origin has

engendered  solid customer  relationships.  We believe that Origin's  management
team has developed a solid  infrastructure  that is capable of supporting a much
larger enterprise in the future."

Origin's  Chairman and CEO Dr. Gengchen Han, stated,  "We are very excited about
the possibility of becoming a publicly traded entity in the United States.  On a
post  transaction  basis,  this combination  will  significantly  strengthen our
financial  position and give us added visibility.  The additional equity capital
will  allow  us  to  bolster  our  national  distribution  network,  expand  our
intellectual  property  portfolio  and  increase our level of  penetration  in a
highly  fragmented  marketplace.  In addition,  we will have the capital to make
strategic acquisitions when they become available in the future."

The  closing of the  acquisition  is subject to  customary  closing  conditions,
including Chardan  stockholder  approval of the stock purchase agreement and the
redomestication  of Chardan as a British  Virgin  Islands  company by means of a
merger into a wholly owned subsidiary.  In addition,  the closing is conditioned
on  holders  of not more  than 20% of the  shares of  Chardan  issued in the IPO
voting  against the business  combination  and electing to convert their Chardan
shares into cash, as permitted by the Chardan certificate of incorporation.  The
Chardan initial stockholdes and officers and directors, holding about 15% of the
voting stock,  have agreed to vote in favor of the  transaction.  It is expected
that the  transaction  will  close in the second  quarter  of 2005.  There is no
assurance given that the transaction will be approved by shareholders.
