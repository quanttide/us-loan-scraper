ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

     On December 13, 2004, Endwave Corporation ("Endwave") signed an amendment
to a previously-disclosed contract with Nokia Networks ("Nokia"). Specifically,
the amendment expands the range of frequencies covered by Endwave transceiver
products to include lower frequency models. As Nokia is currently Endwave's
largest customer, this contract amendment may be material in that it adds to the
existing multi-year agreement between the companies, and is expected to result
in several million dollars worth of revenue to Endwave.

     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in
this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed
"filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it
be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference
in such a filing.
