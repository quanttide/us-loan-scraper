ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

     On December 13, 2004, Endwave Corporation ("Endwave") signed an amendment
to a previously-disclosed contract with Nokia Networks ("Nokia"). Specifically,
the amendment expands the range of frequencies covered by Endwave transceiver
products to include lower frequency models. As Nokia is currently Endwave's
largest customer, this contract amendment may be material in that it adds to the
existing multi-year agreement between the companies, and is expected to result
in several million dollars worth of revenue to Endwave.

     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in
this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed
"filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it
be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference
in such a filing.

        ENDWAVE AND NOKIA NETWORKS ANNOUNCE THE EXECUTION OF AN AMENDMENT
                      TO THE EXISTING MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENT

       Companies Agree to Expand the Frequencies to be Supplied by Endwave

     SUNNYVALE, Calif., Dec. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Endwave Corporation
(Nasdaq: ENWV), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF) subsystems for
carrier-class cellular infrastructure, broadband wireless networks, homeland
security and defense applications, today announced that it has signed a new
contract amendment with the Networks division of Nokia, valued at several
million dollars, which expands the range of frequencies supplied by Endwave. The
transceivers will be installed in both the Nokia FlexiHopper(TM) and next
generation Nokia FlexiHopper Plus(TM) microwave radios for use in its cellular
networks in Europe, Asia and Latin America over the next two years.

     Endwave's transceivers are customized to seamlessly integrate with Nokia's
FlexiHopper(T)M family of microwave radios, combining the high frequency
transmit and receive functions of a radio system into one package, which can be
used for many communication needs in cellular, fixed and dedicated networks.

     "This follow-on agreement expands upon the range of frequencies Endwave
provides to Nokia and further strengthens our position as a key supplier of
next-generation cellular broadband wireless subsystems," said Ed Keible,
President and CEO of Endwave Corporation. "This contract award highlights
Endwave's ability to extend its world-class technology leadership from the high
millimeter-wave frequencies all the way down to the lower microwave frequency
bands that are so critical to cellular network deployments in emerging markets."

the following: the risks that the integration of acquired business lines,
products and subsidiaries will fail, products will fail to achieve market
acceptance, the timing or existence of customer orders, market volatility and

delays or cancellations due to product defects or defects in materials supplied
by vendors, the length of our sales cycle, our ability to develop, introduce and
market new products and product enhancements, changes in product mix or
distribution channels; the demand for wireless networking products and end-user
products that incorporate wireless technology; competitive technologies; and,
