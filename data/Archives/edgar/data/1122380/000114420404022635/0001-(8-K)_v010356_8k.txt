ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

      On December 22, 2004, Thomas Equipment, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Amalgamation (the "Agreement"), with 4274458 Canada,
Inc., a Canadian corporation wholly-owned by the Company, and Pneutech, Inc., a
Canadian corporation ("Pneutech"). Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company
will acquire 100% of the common stock Pneutech, in exchange for the issuance by
us of a total of 1,250,000 shares of our common stock. Certain of such shares
will be used at the time of closing to eliminate specified Pneutech debt.
Concurrently with the closing of the acquisition, we will:

      o     enter into an agreement with RoyNat Capital, Inc., a principal
            lender of Pneutech, pursuant to which Pneutech obligations will be
            restructured and become direct obligations of Thomas Equipment; and

      o     redeem 929 preference shares and 530,000 special shares owned by
            3156176 Canada, Inc. for an aggregate of CD$630,000.

Clifford Rhee, the President and a member of the Board of Directors of Thomas is
the beneficial owner of 3156176 Canada, Inc., which is the owner of
approximately 47% of the common shares, 929 preference shares and 530,000
special shares of Pneutech. Mr. Rhee is also the President and a member of the
Board of Directors of Pneutech. Upon the completion of the acquisition, Mr. Rhee
will continue to serve as President of both Thomas and Pneutech. The members of
Thomas' Board will become the members of the Pneutech Board.

      Pneutech is a manufacturer of hydraulic systems and is a strategic
supplier to Thomas, as well as 15,000 other active customers. Pneutech maintains
