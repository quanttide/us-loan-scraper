<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Kmart, Sears: Hart-Scott-Rodino Update</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Troy, MI, and Hoffman Estates, IL, December&nbsp;22, 2004 </B>&#150; Following informal discussions with the
staff at the Federal Trade Commission, during which the FTC requested additional time, in light of
the holiday season, to complete its review of the merger, Kmart and Sears announced today that they
voluntarily agreed to withdraw their previously filed Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report
Forms and will refile them by December&nbsp;28, 2004, when the 30-day waiting period will recommence.
Kmart and Sears now expect the FTC review period to expire in January&nbsp;2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Kmart and Sears have been working cooperatively with the FTC as it conducts its review of the
merger, including voluntarily providing additional information to the FTC staff in response to
their informal request. In that regard, the FTC staff recently requested certain information,
which the parties provided, and the staff has requested more time to review it in light of the
holiday season. The parties remain confident that the HSR review will be concluded without causing
any delay in the transaction. The parties remain committed to continuing to cooperate with the FTC
and expect the transaction to close by early March&nbsp;2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">company&#146;s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Kmart&#146;s
and Sears&#146; management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may
differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth
in the forward-looking statements: the ability to obtain governmental approvals of the transaction
on the proposed terms and schedule; the failure of Kmart and Sears stockholders to approve the
transaction; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; failure to quickly
realize synergies and cost-savings from the transaction as a result of technical, logistical,
competitive and other factors; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain
relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; competitive conditions in retail and related
services industries; changes in consumer confidence, tastes, preferences and spending; the
availability and level of consumer debt; anticipated cash flow and the ability of Sears Holdings to
maintain sufficient operating cash flow and liquidity; the successful execution of, and customer
response to, strategic initiatives, including the full-line store strategy and the conversion and
integration of the Kmart stores and other new store locations; the pace of growth in store
locations, which may be higher or lower than anticipated; the possibility that new business and
strategic options for one or more business segments will be identified, potentially including
selective acquisitions, dispositions, restructurings, joint ventures and partnerships; trade
restrictions, tariffs, and other factors potentially affecting the ability to find qualified
vendors and access products in an efficient manner; the ability to successfully implement
initiatives to improve inventory management capabilities; anticipated cash flow; changes in
interest rates; the outcome of pending legal proceedings and bankruptcy claims; social and
political conditions such as war, political unrest and terrorism or natural disasters; the
possibility of negative investment returns in any pension plans; volatility in financial markets;
changes in debt ratings, credit spreads and cost of funds; the possibility of interruptions in
systematically accessing the public debt markets; the impact of seasonal buying patterns, which are
difficult to forecast with certainty; and general economic conditions and normal business
uncertainty. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the time first made, and no
undertaking has been made to update or revise them as more information becomes available.
Additional factors that could cause Kmart&#146;s and Sears&#146; results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the 2003 Annual Reports on Forms 10-K
of Kmart and Sears filed with the SEC and available at the SEC&#146;s Internet site
(http://www.sec.gov).
