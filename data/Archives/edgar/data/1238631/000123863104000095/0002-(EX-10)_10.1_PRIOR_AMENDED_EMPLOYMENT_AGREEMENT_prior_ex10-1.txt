(b); and (d) the value of any other non-cash benefit or of any deferred cash
payment included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Company's
independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3)

abide by the following covenant not to compete:

                  (a)      Term and Scope. During his employment with the
Company and for a period of two (2) years after the Term, Executive will not
render to any Conflicting Organization (as hereinafter defined), services,
directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world in connection with any Conflicting
Product, except that Executive may accept employment with a large Conflicting
Organization whose business is diversified (and which has separate and distinct
divisions) if Executive first certifies to the Board of Directors in writing
that he has provided a copy of Section 5 of this Agreement to such prospective
employer, that such prospective employer is a separate and distinct division of
the Conflicting Organization and that Executive will not render services
directly or indirectly in respect of any Conflicting Product (as hereinafter
defined). Such two-year time period shall be tolled during any period that
Executive is engaged in activity in violation of this covenant.

                  (b)      Judicial Action. Executive and the Company agree
that, if the period of time or the scope of the restrictive covenant not to
compete contained in this Section 5.4 shall be adjudged unreasonable in any
court proceeding, then the period of time and/or scope shall be reduced
accordingly, so that this covenant may be enforced in such scope and during
such period of time as is judged by the court to be reasonable. In the event of
a breach or violation of this Section 5.4 by Executive, the parties agree than
in addition to all other remedies, the Company shall be entitled to equitable
relief for specific performance, and Executive hereby agrees and acknowledges
that the Company has no adequate remedy at law for the breach of the covenants
contained herein.

                  under development at the time Executive's employment with the
                  Company terminates, that is the same as or similar to or
