sell to the several Underwriters named in Schedule&nbsp;II hereto (the &#147;<B>Underwriters</B>&#148;), and the
shareholder of the Company named in Schedule&nbsp;I-A hereto (&#147;<B>SPEI</B>&#148;), the shareholders of the Company
named in Schedule&nbsp;I-B hereto (the &#147;<B>Non-Management Selling Shareholders</B>&#148;) and the Shareholders of
the Company named in Schedule&nbsp;I-C hereto (the &#147;<B>Management Selling Shareholders</B>&#148; and together with
SPEI and the Non-Management Selling Shareholders, the &#147;<B>Selling Shareholders</B>&#148;) severally propose to
sell to the several Underwriters, an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares (the &#147;<B>Firm Shares</B>&#148;) of the
common stock, par value $.01, of the Company (the &#147;<B>Common Stock</B>&#148;), of which 1,500,000 shares are to
be issued and sold by the Company and 6,000,000 shares are to be sold by the Selling Shareholders,
each Selling Shareholder selling the amount set forth opposite such Selling Shareholder&#146;s name in

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">SPEI proposes to sell to the several Underwriters not more than an additional 1,125,000 shares
of Common Stock (the &#147;<B>Additional Shares</B>&#148;), if and to the extent that you, as Managers of the
offering, shall have determined to exercise, on behalf of the Underwriters, the right to purchase
such shares of common stock granted to the Underwriters in Section&nbsp;3 hereof. The Firm Shares and
the Additional Shares are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;<B>Shares</B>.&#148; The Company and
the Selling Shareholders are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the &#147;<B>Sellers</B>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<B>Commission</B>&#148;) a

as amended at the time it becomes effective, including the information (if any) deemed to be part

Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<B>Securities Act</B>&#148;), is hereinafter referred to as the
&#147;<B>Registration Statement</B>&#148;; the prospectus in the form first used to confirm sales of Shares is
hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<B>Prospectus</B>.&#148; If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration
statement to register additional shares of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the
Securities Act (the &#147;<B>Rule&nbsp;462 Registration Statement</B>&#148;), then any reference herein to the term
&#147;<B>Registration Statement</B>&#148; shall be deemed to include such Rule&nbsp;462 Registration Statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">1.&nbsp;<I>Representations and Warranties of the Company</I>. The Company represents and warrants to and
agrees with each of the Underwriters that:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Based on advice from the Commission, the Registration Statement has become
effective; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in
effect, and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened by the Commission.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b) (i)&nbsp;The Registration Statement, when it became effective, did not contain and, as

Prospectus comply and, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will comply in all
material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder; and (iii)&nbsp;the Prospectus does not contain and, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that the
representations and warranties set forth in this paragraph do not apply to statements or
omissions in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus based upon information relating
to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you
expressly for use therein.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate
power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property
requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or
be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (collectively, the &#147;<B>WellCare Group</B>&#148;).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;Each subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated or organized, as the
case may be, is validly existing as a corporation or limited liability company in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the
case may be, has the power (corporate or limited liability company, as the case may be)
and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the
Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property
requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or
be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the WellCare Group; all of
the issued shares of capital stock or membership interests, as the case may be, of each of
the Company&#146;s subsidiaries have been duly and validly authorized and issued or created, as
the case may be, and, in the case of shares of capital stock, are fully paid and
non-assessable; and in each case such capital stock or membership interest, as the case
may be, is owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, equities or claims, except as described in the Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:9%; font-size: 12pt">(e)&nbsp;This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(f)&nbsp;The authorized capital stock of the Company conforms as to legal matters to the
description thereof contained in the Prospectus; and except as disclosed in the
Prospectus, there are no outstanding securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or
warrants, rights or options to subscribe to or purchase from the Company, or obligation of
the Company to issue, shares of Common Stock.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;The shares of Common Stock (including the Shares to be sold by the Selling
Shareholders) outstanding prior to the issuance of the Shares to be sold by the Company
have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; and there
are no restrictions on transfer of or encumbrances on the Shares to be sold by the Selling
Shareholders pursuant to this Agreement under the laws of the State of Delaware or the
certificate of incorporation of the Company.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(h)&nbsp;The Shares to be sold by the Company have been duly authorized and, when issued
and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable; and the issuance of such Shares will not be subject to any
preemptive or similar rights.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company
of its obligations under, this Agreement will not contravene any provision of applicable
law or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, or any agreement or
other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is material to
the WellCare Group, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or
court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and no consent,
approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any governmental body or
agency is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement, except such as may be required by the Securities Act, the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<B>Exchange Act</B>&#148;), the rules and regulations of the
New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;<B>NYSE</B>&#148;) or the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various
states in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(j)&nbsp;There has not occurred any material adverse change, or any development involving
a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the
earnings, business or operations of the WellCare Group, from that set forth in the
Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of
this Agreement).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(k)&nbsp;There are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to
which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are
required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not so
described or any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to
be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to
the Registration Statement that are not described or filed as required.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(l)&nbsp;Each preliminary prospectus filed as part of the registration statement as
originally filed or as part of any amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424 under
the Securities Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the Securities
Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(m)&nbsp;The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the
Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will
not be, required to register as an &#147;investment company&#148; as such term is defined in the

licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to

conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except where such noncompliance with

failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, licenses or approvals
would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the WellCare
Group.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(o)&nbsp;There are no costs or liabilities associated with Environmental Laws (including,
without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure
of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws or any permit, license or approval,
any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third
parties) which would, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
WellCare Group.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(p)&nbsp;There are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any
person granting such person the right to require the Company to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act with respect to any securities of the Company or to
require the Company to include such securities with the Shares registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement, in each case except as described in the Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(q)&nbsp;Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the

simple to all real property and good and marketable title to all personal property owned
by them which is material to the WellCare Group, in each case free and clear of all liens,

materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and
proposed to be made of such property by the WellCare Group; and any real property and
buildings held under lease by each of the Company and its subsidiaries are held by them
under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material
and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and

the Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(s)&nbsp;Except as set forth in the Prospectus, (i)&nbsp;the Company and each of its

and other intellectual property, (collectively, the &#147;<B>Intellectual Property</B>&#148;) necessary for
the operation of the business of the Company and each of its subsidiaries as now
conducted; (ii)&nbsp;none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of
infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of other parties with respect to such
Intellectual Property, and the Company is unaware of any facts which would form a
reasonable basis for a party to send such a notice; (iii)&nbsp;to the knowledge of the Company,
there is no material infringement by third parties of any such Intellectual Property that
is owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and (iv)
there is no pending or, to the Company&#146;s knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or
claim by any third party that the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries infringes or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any third
party, and the Company is unaware of any other fact which would form a reasonable basis
for any such claim.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(t)&nbsp;No material labor dispute with the employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent; and none of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is aware of any existing, threatened or imminent labor
disturbance by the employees of any of its principal suppliers, manufacturers or
contractors that could have a material adverse effect on the WellCare Group.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(u)&nbsp;None of the following events has occurred or exists: (i)&nbsp;a failure to fulfill the
obligations, if any, under the minimum funding standards of Section&nbsp;302 of the United
States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;<B>ERISA</B>&#148;), and the
regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to a Plan, determined
without regard to any waiver of such obligations or extension of any amortization period;
(ii)&nbsp;an audit or investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other federal or state governmental
agency or any foreign regulatory agency with respect to the employment or compensation of
employees by any member of the WellCare Group that could have a material adverse effect on
the WellCare Group; or (iii)&nbsp;any breach by any member of the WellCare Group of any
contractual obligation to employees that could have a material adverse effect on the
WellCare Group. None of the following events has or is reasonably likely to occur: (A)&nbsp;a
material increase in the aggregate amount of contributions required to be made to all
Plans in the current fiscal year of the WellCare Group compared to the amount of such
contributions made in the WellCare Group&#146;s most recently completed fiscal year; (B)&nbsp;a
material increase in the WellCare Group&#146;s &#147;accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligations&#148; (within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 106)
compared to the amount of such obligations in the WellCare Group&#146;s most recently completed
fiscal year; (C)&nbsp;the termination of any Plan the assets of which are not sufficient to pay
benefit liabilities; or (D)&nbsp;the filing of a claim by one or more employees or former
employees of the WellCare Group related to their employment that could have a material
adverse effect on the WellCare Group. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &#147;Plan&#148;
means a plan (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA
with respect to which any member of the WellCare Group may have any liability.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(v)&nbsp;The Company and each of its subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized
financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent
and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged; and none of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its
existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar
coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that
would not have a material adverse effect on the WellCare Group.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(w)&nbsp;None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is (i)&nbsp;in violation of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational document, as the case may
be, or (ii)&nbsp;in default in any material respect, and no event has occurred which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the due performance
or observance of any term, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, credit agreement or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or
by which it is bound or to which any of its property or assets is subject.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(x)&nbsp;The Company and each of its subsidiaries (i)&nbsp;are in compliance with, and conduct
their respective businesses in conformity with, all applicable federal, state and local
laws and regulations, except where the failure to so comply or conform would not have a
material adverse effect on the WellCare Group; (ii)&nbsp;have received all permits, licenses
and other approvals issued by the appropriate federal, state or local regulatory
authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses, except where the failure to
receive such permits, licenses or other approvals would not have a material adverse effect
on the WellCare Group; (iii)&nbsp;are in compliance with all terms and conditions of any such
permit, license or other approval, except where such noncompliance would not have a
material adverse effect on the WellCare Group; and (iv)&nbsp;none of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or
modification of any such permit, license or other approval which, singly or in the
aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a
material adverse effect on the WellCare Group, except in each case as described in the
Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(y)&nbsp;The Company and each of its subsidiaries have filed all federal, state and local
tax returns required to be filed through the date of this Agreement or have requested
extensions thereof (except for cases in which the failure to file would not have a
material adverse effect on the WellCare Group) and have paid all taxes due thereon, and,
except as currently being contested in good faith and for which reserves required by
generally accepted accounting principles have been created on the financial statements of
the Company, no tax deficiency has been determined adversely to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries which has had (nor does the Company or any of its subsidiaries have any
knowledge of any tax deficiency which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have) a material adverse effect on the
WellCare Group.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(z)&nbsp;The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i)&nbsp;transactions are executed in
accordance with management&#146;s general or specific authorizations; (ii)&nbsp;transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability; (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management&#146;s general or specific
authorization; and (iv)&nbsp;the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the
existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(aa)&nbsp;Based on its evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting, the
Company is not aware that there has been, since the end of the Company&#146;s most recent
audited fiscal year, any material weakness or reportable condition in the Company&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:5%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(bb)&nbsp;The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act; such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company&#146;s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others within the Company, and such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to perform the functions for which they
were established; the Company&#146;s auditor and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors
have been advised of: (i)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial data; and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a role in the Company&#146;s internal controls;
any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the Company&#146;s
auditors; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and
procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other

and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any
amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the
Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or the Form 8-K filed by the
Company with the Commission on November&nbsp;4, 2004 (including the exhibit furnished therewith), or
caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the
Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein; <I>provided, however,</I>
that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure
to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities purchased Shares, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if it is established that
a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to
such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation
of the sale of the Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented)
would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities; and
<I>provided, further</I>, that the liability of each Management Selling Shareholder under such Management
Selling Shareholder&#146;s representations and warranties contained in Sections&nbsp;2(b)(vi)(A) and
2(b)(vii) hereof and under this paragraph (a)&nbsp;shall be limited to an amount equal to the net
proceeds received by such Management Selling Shareholder from the sale of such Management Selling
Shareholder&#146;s Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(b)&nbsp;Each of SPEI and the Non-Management Selling Shareholders, severally and not jointly,
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of either Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act or Section&nbsp;20 of the
Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including,
without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or
investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating specifically to such
Selling Shareholder, as set forth under the caption &#147;Principal and Selling Stockholders&#148; (including
the notes thereto); <I>provided, however, </I>that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any
preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person
asserting such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Shares, or any person controlling
such Underwriter, if it is established that a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or
supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not
sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have
been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Shares to such person,
and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities; and <I>provided, further, </I>that with respect to any amount
due an indemnified person under this paragraph (b), each Selling Shareholder shall be liable only
to the extent of the net proceeds received by the Selling Shareholder from the sale of such Selling
Shareholder&#146;s Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(c)&nbsp;Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Selling Shareholders, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who
sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling
Shareholder within the meaning of either Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act or Section&nbsp;20 of the
Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including,
without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or
investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter
furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the
Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(d)&nbsp;In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted
involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section&nbsp;9(a), 9(b) or
9(c), such person (the &#147;<B>indemnified party</B>&#148;) shall promptly notify the person against whom such
indemnity may be sought (the &#147;<B>indemnifying party</B>&#148;) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon
request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in
such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such
proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified
party unless (i)&nbsp;the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the
retention of such counsel or (ii)&nbsp;the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal
expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the
same jurisdiction, be liable for (A)&nbsp;the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in
addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control any
Underwriter within the meaning of either Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act or Section&nbsp;20 of the
Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;405 under the
Securities Act, (B)&nbsp;the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section; (C)&nbsp;the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Selling
Shareholders (other than SPEI) and all persons, if any, who control any such Selling Shareholder
within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed
as they are incurred; and (D)&nbsp;the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to
any local counsel) for SPEI and all persons who control SPEI within the meaning of either such
Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case
of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of any
Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley. In the case of any such
separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company,
such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for
the Selling Shareholders (other than SPEI) and such control persons of such Selling Shareholders,
such firm shall be designated in writing by the persons named as attorneys in fact for such Selling
Shareholders under the Powers of Attorney. In the case of any such separate firm for SPEI and such
control persons of SPEI, such firm shall be designated in writing by SPEI. The indemnifying party
shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but
if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying
party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of
such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified
party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and
expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the
indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent if (1)&nbsp;such settlement is entered into more than 30&nbsp;days after receipt
by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (2)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall not have
reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such
settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified
party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by
such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(e)&nbsp;To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section&nbsp;9(a), 9(b) or 9(c) is
unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i)&nbsp;in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or
parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of
the Shares or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause 9(e)(i) above is not permitted by
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
referred to in clause 9(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or
parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection
with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Sellers
on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the
Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the
offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by each Seller and the total
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in
the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the
Shares. The relative fault of the Sellers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by the Sellers or by the Underwriters and the parties&#146; relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Underwriters&#146; respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9 are several in
proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint. In no
event shall the liability of any Selling Shareholder under this Section 9(e) exceed the amount that
such Selling Shareholder would have been required to pay under Section 9(b) had such
indemnification been held to be available thereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(f)&nbsp;The Sellers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9 were determined by <I>pro rata </I>allocation (even if the
Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section&nbsp;9(e). The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty
of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section&nbsp;9 are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any
indemnified party at law or in equity. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;9 shall not supersede or
otherwise affect any agreement that the Sellers may otherwise have with respect to indemnification
between them.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 9%">(g)&nbsp;The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section&nbsp;9 and the
representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Selling Shareholders
contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i)
any termination of this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter,
any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, any Selling Shareholder
or any person controlling any Selling Shareholder, or the Company, its officers or directors or any
person controlling the Company and (iii)&nbsp;acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">10.&nbsp;<I>Termination</I>. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the
Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i)
trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be,
any of the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market; (ii)&nbsp;trading of any
securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter
market; (iii)&nbsp;a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the
United States shall have occurred; (iv)&nbsp;any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have
been declared by Federal or New York State authorities; or (v)&nbsp;there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis
that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event
specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed
with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
Prospectus.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">11.&nbsp;<I>Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters</I>. This Agreement shall become effective upon the
execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the
Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase
hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate
number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated
severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective
names in Schedule&nbsp;II bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of
all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase
the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to
purchase on such date; <I>provided </I>that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter
has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section&nbsp;11 by an
amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such
Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to
purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default
occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased, and
arrangements satisfactory to you, the Company and the Selling Shareholders for the purchase of such
Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without
liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Selling Shareholders.
In any such case either you or the relevant Sellers shall have the right to postpone the Closing
Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in
the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be
effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to
purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such
default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased
on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i)&nbsp;terminate
their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date
or (ii)&nbsp;purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting
Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action
taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect
of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any
failure or refusal on the part of any Seller to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the
conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason any Seller shall be unable to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, the Sellers will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters
as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket
expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by
such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">12.&nbsp;<I>Counterparts</I>. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">13.&nbsp;<I>Applicable Law</I>. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of New York.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 5%">14.&nbsp;<I>Headings</I>. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Dear Sirs and Mesdames:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">The undersigned understands that Morgan Stanley (&#147;<B>Morgan Stanley</B>&#148;) proposes to enter into an
Underwriting Agreement (the &#147;<B>Underwriting Agreement</B>&#148;) with WellCare Health Plans, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), providing for the public offering (the &#147;<B>Public Offering</B>&#148;) by the
several Underwriters, including Morgan Stanley (the &#147;<B>Underwriters</B>&#148;), of 7,500,000 shares (the
&#147;<B>Shares</B>&#148;) of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<B>Common Stock</B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">To induce the Underwriters that may participate in the Public Offering to continue their
efforts in connection with the Public Offering, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the
prior written consent of Morgan Stanley on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the
period commencing on the date hereof and ending 90&nbsp;days after the date of the final prospectus
relating to the Public Offering (the &#147;<B>Prospectus</B>&#148;), (1)&nbsp;offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell
any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option,
right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly,
any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Common Stock, or (2)&nbsp;enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such
transaction described in clause (1)&nbsp;or (2)&nbsp;above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or
such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a)
transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market
transactions after the completion of the Public Offering, (b)&nbsp;transfers of shares of Common Stock
or any security convertible into Common Stock as a bona fide gift or gifts or in connection with
estate planning (c)&nbsp;distributions or transfers of shares of Common Stock or any security
convertible into Common Stock to limited partners, stockholders or controlled affiliates of the
undersigned or (d)&nbsp;the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provided that no sales or other transfers occur under such plan
during the restricted period referred to above in this paragraph; <I>provided </I>that in the case of any
transfer or distribution pursuant to clause (b)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;each donee, distributee or transferee shall
sign and deliver a lock-up letter substantially in the form of this letter. In addition, the
undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley on behalf of the
Underwriters, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 90&nbsp;days after
the date of the Prospectus, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the
registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop
transfer instructions with the Company&#146;s transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the
undersigned&#146;s share of Common Stock except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">If:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">(1)&nbsp;during the last 17&nbsp;days of the 90-day restricted period the Company issues an earnings
release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 12pt">(2)&nbsp;prior to the expiration of the 90-day restricted period, the Company announces that it
will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the
90-day period,


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">the restrictions imposed by this letter shall continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day
period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or
material event.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters are relying upon this
agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the Public Offering. The undersigned further
understands that this agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned&#146;s heirs,
legal representatives, successors and assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Whether or not the Public Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including
market conditions. Any Public Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement,
the terms of which are subject to negotiation between the Company and the Underwriters. This
agreement shall automatically terminate if the purchase of the Firm Shares (as defined in the
Underwriting Agreement) pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement is not completed within 10 business
days of the date of the Prospectus.
