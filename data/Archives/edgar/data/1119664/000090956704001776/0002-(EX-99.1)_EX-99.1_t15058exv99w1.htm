<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Nortel Provides Status Update</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">TORONTO &#150; Nortel Networks* Corporation &#091;NYSE/TSX:NT&#093; and its principal operating subsidiary,
Nortel Networks Limited (&#147;NNL&#148;), today provided a status update pursuant to the alternative
information guidelines of the Ontario Securities Commission. These guidelines contemplate that the
Company and NNL will normally provide bi-weekly updates on their affairs until such time as they
are current with their filing obligations under Canadian securities laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company and NNL reported that there have been no material developments in the matters reported
in their status updates of June&nbsp;2, 2004, June&nbsp;15, 2004, June&nbsp;29, 2004, July&nbsp;13, 2004, July&nbsp;27,
2004, August&nbsp;10, 2004, August&nbsp;19, 2004, September&nbsp;2, 2004, September&nbsp;16, 2004, September&nbsp;30, 2004,
October&nbsp;14, 2004, October&nbsp;27, 2004, November&nbsp;11, 2004, November&nbsp;24, 2004 and December&nbsp;8, 2004; the
Company&#146;s press release &#147;Nortel Networks Announces New Waiver from Export Development Canada&#148; dated
December&nbsp;10, 2004; and the Company&#146;s press release &#147;Nortel Provides Estimated Unaudited Results for
Q1, Q2 and Q3 2004 and Years 2001, 2002 and 2003&#148; dated December&nbsp;14, 2004, with the exception of
the matters described below.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Annual
Shareholders&#146; Meeting</B></U>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company today was granted an order by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the &#147;Court&#148;)
extending the time for calling the Company&#146;s 2004 Annual Shareholders&#146; Meeting (the &#147;Meeting&#148;) to a
date no later than May&nbsp;31, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company had previously obtained an earlier order from the Court extending the time for calling
the Meeting to a date no later than March&nbsp;31, 2005 so that the Company&#146;s 2003 audited financial
statements could be completed and mailed to shareholders in time for the Meeting. The latest
extension was obtained, after discussions with the Staff of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;), to permit compliance with a specific SEC rule which would require,
in these circumstances, that the Company provide to shareholders its 2004 audited financial
statements either prior to or concurrently with the mailing of the proxy materials for the Meeting.
As this would not be possible if the Meeting were to be held by March&nbsp;31, 2005 (which would
require the Company to commence the mailing of its proxy materials by no later than mid February
2005), the Company applied for and was granted an order by the Court further extending the time for
calling the Meeting to a date no later than May&nbsp;31, 2005 in order to permit the Company to comply
with this requirement of United States securities laws. Despite the need to obtain this further
extension, the Company and its Board of Directors remain committed to holding the Meeting at the
earliest practicable time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This order does not have any impact on the Company&#146;s expectation, most recently announced in its
December&nbsp;8, 2004 press release and subject to the limitations therein, as to the commencement of
the filing

statements for the first and second quarters of 2004 and related periodic reports on January&nbsp;10,

financial statements and related periodic reports for the third quarter of 2004, and any required
amendments to periodic reports for prior periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s and NNL&#146;s next bi-weekly status update is expected to be released during the week of
January&nbsp;3, 2005.
