<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CLEVELAND </B>&#150; December&nbsp;20, 2004 &#150; PolyOne Corporation (NYSE: <B>POL</B>), a leading global polymer
compounding and North American distribution company, today began, as previously announced, to
provide regular mid-quarter updates of its quarterly financial outlook. The Company stated in its
October&nbsp;27, 2004, earnings release that it would begin such updates in the fourth quarter to inform
investors of any material changes to major business drivers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Today, PolyOne reaffirmed its expectation that revenues from continuing operations in
fourth-quarter 2004 will increase between 5&nbsp;percent and 10&nbsp;percent over fourth-quarter 2003
revenues. As anticipated, revenues from continuing operations likely will decrease from the third
quarter of 2004 due to seasonal slowing. The European business, however, is slowing more than
expected, due primarily to the strong euro and high energy costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">All of PolyOne&#146;s North American and International operating units are experiencing margin pressure
from higher raw material, additive and freight costs. Particularly affected are the Company&#146;s
Vinyl Compound, International and Formulators units. Ethylene and its derivatives inflated cost
faster than previously anticipated, resulting in higher raw material costs. In addition, plant
utility costs are now expected to be higher than previously anticipated due to higher energy costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">While the Company is working to mitigate these adverse effects by raising product prices and other
means, it has revised its operating income outlook. PolyOne continues to expect improved operating
income improvement compared with the fourth quarter of 2003. Even so, because of the combinations
of factors above including a slower European business, the Company now projects that its
Performance Plastics segment operating income will be $5&nbsp;million to $8&nbsp;million lower than the range
discussed in the October&nbsp;27, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Despite the margin squeeze, PolyOne continues to generate good cash flow and to reduce debt.
PolyOne also made a substantial pension contribution in December. The Company expects that the
aggregate debt reduction and pension contribution in 2004 will be approximately $235&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, in the fourth quarter, PolyOne will recognize an expense of between $2&nbsp;million and $3
million due to the partial vesting of stock appreciation rights under its long-term incentive
program.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This expense was triggered when PolyOne&#146;s share price exceeded price performance targets of $8 and
$9 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">All other factors discussed in the fourth-quarter 2004 outlook contained in its third-quarter
earnings release of October&nbsp;27, 2004, remain unchanged, including the following:

    <TD>PolyOne continues to anticipate that operating income from its Resin &#038; Intermediates
business will decline between $2&nbsp;million and $4&nbsp;million compared with the third quarter of
2004. Stronger-than-anticipated polyvinyl chloride (PVC)&nbsp;resin demand as well as higher
PVC and caustic prices are expected to offset higher ethylene costs in the fourth quarter.</TD>

    <TD>Net income from discontinued operations should be lower compared with the third quarter
of 2004 due to the August&nbsp;2004 sale of the Elastomers and Performance Additives unit,
continuing margin pressure, and lower seasonal demand for Specialty Resins and Engineered
Films products. As a result, the discontinued businesses should contribute between $3
million and $4&nbsp;million less in net income in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter
of 2004.</TD>

    <TD>Cost levels should approximate third-quarter levels. Interest expense should decline by
