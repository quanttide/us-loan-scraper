<P>Southlake Town Square has become a true community-gathering place due to its collection of parks, governmental uses, retail stores, offices and restaurants.&nbsp; The project's planning and architecture quotes heavily from successful small towns all across America.&nbsp; Originally opening in March 1999 and progressively added to every year since, Southlake Town Square currently includes over 450,000 square feet of leasable improvements in addition to the Post Office and the Town Hall, which houses both City and County offices as well as the library.&nbsp; Centrally located public parks incorporate a large public fountain and bandshell pavilion.&nbsp; Future phases include a Brownstone residential neighborhood (currently under construction, with the first phase scheduled for completion in December 2005) and the Grand Avenue District, a collection of complementary retail and restaurant uses as well as a movie theater, bookstore, hotel, and office district.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grand Avenue District will commenc
e construction early next year and open in April 2006.</P>

<P>"We're truly excited to be part of this project. It's one of the most well conceived projects in the country and it has amazing prospects for future growth based upon its already well established track record of successful results," said Matt Tice, who negotiated the transaction for Inland.</P>
