<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><b><I>PHILADELPHIA, PA - December 20, 2004

announced, the Company has hedged 3.9 bcf of natural gas (48% of projected production) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005
at a price of $6.67 mcf and 1.7 bcf of natural gas (38% of projected production) for the six months ending March 31, 2006 at a price
of $6.83 per mcf.  Total hedged production for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005 and the six months ending March 31, 2006 has

volumes set forth in the previous paragraphs represent hedged volumes net to the Company&#146;s interest.  Atlas America owns
approximately 33% of the total production hedged.</FONT></P>
