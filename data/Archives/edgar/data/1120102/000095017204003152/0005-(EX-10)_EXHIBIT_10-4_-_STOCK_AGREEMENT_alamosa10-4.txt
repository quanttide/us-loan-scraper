Inc. (the "Company") and the Grantee. The Grantee and the Company hereby agree
as follows:

1.       The Company, pursuant to the Amended and Restated 1999 Long Term
         Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan"), which is incorporated herein
         by reference, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, hereby
         grants to the Grantee the above mentioned Shares of Restricted Stock
         in exchange for a payment of $___ which represents payment of the par
         value of the Shares of Restricted Stock.

2.       From the Grant Date until the date on which all restrictions
         applicable to Shares shall lapse, as indicated above (such period, a
         "Restricted Period"), the Grantee may not sell, assign, transfer,
         donate, pledge or otherwise dispose of Shares subject to a Restricted
         Period. Each certificate representing Restricted Stock shall bear the
         following legend:

                  On the face of the certificate:

                  "Transfer of this stock is restricted in accordance with
                  conditions printed on the reverse of this certificate."

                  On the reverse:

                  "The shares of stock evidenced by this certificate are
                  subject to and transferable only in accordance with that
                  certain Alamosa Holdings, Inc. 1999 Long Term Incentive Plan,
                  a copy of which is on file at the principal office of the
                  Company in Lubbock, Texas. No transfer or pledge of the
                  shares evidenced hereby may be made except in accordance with
                  and subject to the provisions of said Plan. By acceptance of
                  this certificate, any holder, transferee or pledgee hereof
                  agrees to be bound by all of the provisions of said Plan."

         The Grantee shall be entitled to have such legend removed from such
         certificate when all restrictions, as described herein, with respect
         to the Shares of Restricted Stock covered thereby have lapsed.

3.       The Company further grants to the Grantee the right to receive,
         subject to the terms and conditions hereof, up to an aggregate of
         _____ shares of the Company's common stock, free of restrictions, if
         and to the extent the Expected Performance is exceeded (such
         additional shares, "Bonus Stock"). As a condition to issuance of any
         earned Bonus Stock, the Grantee shall be obligated to pay to the
         Company an amount equal to the Per Share Price for each share of such
         Bonus Stock.

4.       Except as set forth below, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock
         and Bonus Stock which shall become earned, subject to the vesting
         restrictions described herein, shall be determined by the Company's
         Effective Performance in relation to the Performance Goals, in
         accordance with the following schedule:

</TABLE>

         The Company's Effective Performance shall be calculated by multiplying
         the Company's Operating Effectiveness Factor (derived from the table
         on Attachment 1) by the Company's EBITDA, each as determined by the
         Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), with respect to the
         fiscal year ending on _____.

         (a)      Restricted Stock Pro-rated Vesting. In the event that the
                  Company's Effective Performance is greater than the Minimum
                  Performance but equal to or less than the Expected
                  Performance, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock which
                  shall become earned, subject to the vesting restrictions
                  described herein, shall be a number of Shares, rounded to the
                  nearest whole number, equal to the product of (i) _____
                  multiplied by (ii) a fraction, not to exceed one, the
                  numerator of which is the Company's Effective Performance
                  less the Minimum Performance and the denominator of which is
                  the Expected Performance less the Minimum Performance. Any
                  Shares of Restricted Stock that are not earned as of _____ in
                  accordance with this Section 4 shall be forfeited and
                  cancelled as of such date, the Per Share Price paid with
                  respect to such Shares shall be refunded to the Grantee, and
                  the Grantee shall have no rights with respect to any Shares
                  of Bonus Stock.

         (b)      Bonus Stock Grants. Subject to Sections 5 and 6 hereof, in
                  the event that the Company's Effective Performance is greater
                  than the Expected Performance and equal to or lesser than the
                  Exceptional Performance, the Company shall issue to Grantee,
                  subject to the terms hereof, a number of Shares, rounded to
                  the nearest whole number, equal to the product of (i) _____
                  multiplied by (ii) a fraction, not to exceed one, the
                  numerator of which is the Company's Effective Performance
                  less the Expected Performance and the denominator of which is
                  the Exceptional Performance less the Expected Performance.
                  Any Shares of Bonus Stock earned pursuant to this Section
                  4(b) shall be issued to the Grantee pro rata (rounded to the
                  nearest whole Share) in accordance with the percentages set
                  forth on Page 1, under "Vesting Dates Upon Which Restrictions
                  Lapse."

5.       Except as set forth below, a percentage of the Shares of Restricted
         Stock and shares of Bonus Stock, if any, earned in accordance with
         Section 4 shall vest (in the case of Restricted Stock) or shall be
         issued (in the case of Bonus Stock) on the Vesting Dates, provided the
         Grantee is employed by, or providing services to, the Company on such
         applicable Vesting Date. If the Grantee's employment with, or
         provision of services to, the Company shall terminate for any reason
         while Shares are subject to a Restricted Period, all Shares held by
         the Grantee still subject to a Restricted Period (whether or not
         earned under Section 4 hereof) shall be forfeited upon such
         termination and the Per Share Price paid with respect to such Shares
         shall be refunded to the Grantee, provided, however, that all Shares
         of Restricted Stock shall be deemed earned and all restrictions
         imposed on the Restricted Stock shall lapse immediately prior to
         Grantee's termination of employment for "Good Reason" or if the
         Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause" or
         by reason of the Grantee's death or "Disability" (each as defined in
         Grantee's employment agreement with the Company entered into effective
         _____); and provided, further, that no Shares of Bonus Stock shall be
         deemed earned or vestd in connection with such a termination of
         employment.

6.       In the event that, prior to ______, 20__, there shall occur a Change
         of Control, (i) as of immediately prior to such Change of Control, all
         of the Restricted Shares shall be deemed fully earned at the Expected
         Performance Level and (ii) as of immediately prior to such Change of
         Control, the Grantee shall be issued a number of Bonus Stock Shares as
         follows:

         (a)      If such Change of Control occurs during the first calendar
                  quarter of 20__, __ Bonus Stock Shares shall be deemed
                  earned;

         (b)      If such Change of Control occurs during the second calendar
                  quarter of 20__ and the Effective Performance for the period
                  from the beginning of 20__ through the end of the first
                  quarter of 20__ exceeds budgeted EBITDA for such period, a
                  number of Bonus Stock Shares shall be deemed earned, which
                  number shall be determined by multiplying (i) ____ by (ii) a
                  fraction, not to exceed one, the numerator of which is the
                  Company's Effective Performance for such first quarter
                  (capped at 120% of budgeted EBITDA for such period) less
                  budgeted EBITDA for such first quarter and the denominator of
                  which is 120% of budgeted EBITDA for such first quarter less
                  budgeted EBITDA for such period;

         (c)      If such Change of Control occurs during the third calendar
                  quarter of 20__ and the Effective Performance for the period
                  from the beginning of 20__ through the end of the second
                  quarter of 20__ exceeds budgeted EBITDA for such period, a
                  number of Bonus Stock Shares shall be deemed earned, which
                  number shall be determined by multiplying (i) _____ by (ii) a
                  fraction, not to exceed one, the numerator of which is the
                  Company's Effective Performance for such period (capped at
                  120% of budgeted EBITDA for such period) less budgeted EBITDA
                  for such period and the denominator of which is 120% of
                  budgeted EBITDA for such period less budgeted EBITDA for such
                  period.

         (d)      If such Change of Control occurs during the fourth calendar
                  quarter of 20__ and the Effective Performance for the period
                  from the beginning of 20__ through the end of the third
                  quarter of 20__ exceeds budgeted EBITDA for such period, a
                  number of Bonus Stock Shares shall be deemed earned, which
                  number shall be determined by multiplying (i) _____ by (ii) a
                  fraction, not to exceed one, the numerator of which is the
                  Company's Effective Performance for such period (capped at
                  120% of budgeted EBITDA for such period) less budgeted EBITDA
                  for such period and the denominator of which is 120% of
                  budgeted EBITDA for such period less budgeted EBITDA for such
                  period.

7.       During the Restricted Period, the Grantee shall have the right to vote
         Shares of Restricted Stock and to receive any dividends or
         distributions paid on such Shares. The Grantee shall have no rights
         with respect to Bonus Stock until such time as such shares have been
         issued to the Grantee and the Per Share Price therefor has been paid
         by the Grantee.

8.       The Shares shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock
         dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares or other
         change in capitalization with a similar substantive effect upon the
         Plan or the Restricted Stock. The Board shall have the power and sole
         discretion to determine the nature and amount of the adjustment to be
         made, if any. Any adjustment so made shall be final and binding.

9.       The obligation of the Company to deliver any stock under this
         Agreement is specifically subject to all provisions of the Plan and
         all applicable laws, rules, regulations and governmental and
         stockholder approvals.

10.      Any notice by the Grantee to the Company hereunder shall be in writing
         and shall be deemed duly given only upon receipt thereof by the
         Company at its principal offices. Any notice by the Company to the
         Grantee shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given if mailed
         to the Grantee at the address last specified to the Company by the
         Grantee.

11.      The Grantee shall pay to the Company promptly upon request, and in any
         event at the time the Grantee recognizes taxable income in respect of
         the Restricted Shares (or if the Grantee makes an election under
         Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
         "Code"), in connection with such grant), an amount equal to the taxes
         the Company determines it is required to withhold under applicable tax
         laws with respect to the Restricted Shares. Such payment shall be made
         in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock already owned (for at
         least six months) or otherwise issuable upon the lapse of
         restrictions, or in a combination of such methods, subject to the
         terms of the Plan. If Shares otherwise issuable upon vesting of
         Restricted Stock are used to pay withholding taxes, the value of such
         shares shall not be in excess of the minimum statutorily required
         withholding. The Grantee shall promptly notify the Company of any
         election made pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. Grantee
         acknowledges that it is Grantee's sole responsibility and not the
         Company's to file timely the election under Section 83(b) of the Code,
         in the event Grantee desires to make such election.

12.      Grantee hereby grants to the Company a power of attorney to transfer
         any Shares that are forfeited hereunder and shall execute any
         documents requested by the Company in connection with such forfeiture
         and transfer. Grantee agrees that any provisions regarding returns and
         transfers of stock certificates with respect to forfeited Shares are
         specifically performable by the Company in a court of equity or law.

13.      This Agreement may be amended or modified at any time only by an
         instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

14.      This Agreement shall apply to and bind the Grantee and the Company and
         their respective permitted assignees and transferees, heirs, legatees,
         executors, administrators and legal successors.

15.      Neither the grant of Restricted Stock and the Bonus Stock, this
         Agreement nor any other action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall
         constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express
         or implied, that Grantee has a right to continue to provide services
         as an officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company for any
         period of time or at any specific rate of compensation.

16.      The failure of the Company to enforce at any time any provision of
         this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such
         provision or of any other provision hereof.

17.      The validity and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by
         the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding any conflict of law, rule
         or principle of Delaware law that might refer the governance,
         construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the laws of
         another state).


                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to
be executed by a duly authorized representative and the Grantee has hereunto
set his hand as of the Grant Date.
