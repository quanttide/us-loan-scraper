</B><P>On December 20, 2004, the board of directors of the Corporation approved an eight (8) for one (1) forward stock split (the "Forward Stock Split") of the Corporation's authorized, issued and outstanding common stock.  The Forward Stock Split was effected with the Nevada Secretary of State on December 21, 2004 and the record date will be as of December 31, 2004.  As a result, the authorized capital of the Corporation will increase from 25,000,000 to 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. The ratio of distribution is an additional seven (7) shares of common stock for every one (1) share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the Forward Stock Split.  This will increase the issued and outstanding share capital of the Corporation from 3,100,750 shares of common stock to 24,806,000 shares of common stock.</P>
