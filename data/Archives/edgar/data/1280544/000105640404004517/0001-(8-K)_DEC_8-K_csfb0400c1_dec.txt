 (1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures
 become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases the most current
 DSCR provided by the Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by
 the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The Trustee makes
 no representations as to the accuracy of the data provided by the borrower for
 this calculation.
 (2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term

 from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if
 applicable, and the maturity date.

 (3) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan
 information to the properties based upon the Cut-off Date Balance of the related
 mortgage loan as disclosed in the offering document.

 Note: (i) "Scheduled Balance" has the meaning assigned thereto in the CMSA
 Standard Information Package.
