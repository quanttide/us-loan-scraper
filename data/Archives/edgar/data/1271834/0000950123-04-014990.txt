ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

On December 15, 2004, indirect subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc., CCO
Holdings, LLC (CCO Holdings) and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., (with CCO Holdings,
the Issuers) issued $550 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the
Notes). The Notes have a six-year term and have an annual interest rate of LIBOR
plus 4.125%, reset and payable quarterly.

The Issuers may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the Issuers' option from
December 15, 2006 until December 14, 2007 for 102% of the principal amount, from
December 15, 2007 until December 14, 2008 for 101% of the principal amount and
from and after December 15, 2008, at par, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest. At any time prior to December 15, 2006, the Issuers may redeem up to
35% of the Notes in an amount not to exceed the amount of proceeds of one or
more public equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus a premium equal to the interest rate per annum applicable
to the Notes on the date notice of redemption is given, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date, provided that at least 65% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued remains outstanding
after the redemption.

The Notes will be unsecured and will rank equally with all the existing and
future senior unsecured debt of the Issuers and senior to all existing and
future subordinated debt of the Issuers. The Notes will be effectively
subordinated to all of secured obligations of the Issuers to the extent of the
collateral securing those obligations and will be structurally subordinated to
indebtedness and other liability of the Issuers' subsidiaries.

The Issuers plan to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay down
debt of subsidiaries, which may include paying (but not reducing permanently)
revolving balances under Charter Communications Operating LLC's credit
facilities and paying amounts outstanding under their subsidiaries' outstanding
notes, and for general corporate purposes.

Under the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuers are restricted in their
ability to pay dividends on stock or repurchase stock; make investments; borrow
money; grant liens; sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with
or into other companies; use the proceeds from sales of assets and subsidiaries'
stock; in the case of restricted subsidiaries, create or permit to exist
dividend or payment restrictions; and engage in certain transactions with
affiliates.

Upon a change of control, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, the
Issuers may be required to offer to purchase all of the Notes at a purchase
price of 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of the purchase.

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers have agreed to file
with the SEC within ninety (90) days of the date of issuance a registration
statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange the notes for notes
with terms identical in all material respect to the Notes. In addition, the
Issuers have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the exchange offer
registration statement to become effective within 210 days after the date of
issuance; cause the exchange offer to be consummated within 30 business days
after the effective date of the exchange offer registration statement or longer,
if required by the federal securities laws; and file a shelf registration
statement for the resale of the Notes if the Issuers cannot effect an exchange
offer within the specified time period and in certain other circumstances. If
the Issuers fail to comply with certain obligations under the registration
rights agreements, the Issuers will be required to pay special interest to
holders of Notes.

The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A
and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws.

                                    THE NOTES

Section 2.01. Form and Dating.

         (a) General. The Notes and the Trustee's certificate of authentication
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. The Notes may have
notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or
usage. Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication. The Notes shall
be in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.

         The terms and provisions contained in the Notes shall constitute, and
are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and the Issuers and the
Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to
such terms and provisions and to be bound

                                     - 26 -

thereby. However, to the extent any provision of any Note conflicts with the
express provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Indenture shall
govern and be controlling.

         (b) Global Notes. Notes issued in global form shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (including the Global Note Legend thereon
and the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Note" attached
thereto). Notes issued in definitive form shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit A attached hereto (but without the Global Note Legend thereon and
without the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Note" attached
thereto). Each Global Note shall represent such of the outstanding Notes as
shall be specified therein and each shall provide that it shall represent the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed
thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented
thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to
reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Note to reflect
the amount of any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee or the
custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in accordance with instructions
given by the Holder thereof as required by Section 2.06.

         (c) Euroclear and Clearstream Procedures Applicable. The Applicable
Procedures shall apply to transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes that are held by Participants through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Section 2.02. Execution and Authentication.

         Two Officers shall sign the Notes for each Issuer by manual or
facsimile signature.

         If an Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that office
at the time a Note is authenticated, the Note shall nevertheless be valid.

         A Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature
(which may be by facsimile) of the Trustee. The signature shall be conclusive
evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture.

         At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of
this Indenture, the Issuers may deliver Notes executed by the Issuers to the
Trustee for authentication; and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver (i)
Initial Notes for original issue in the aggregate principal amount of
$550,000,000, (ii) Additional Notes from time to time for original issue in
aggregate principal amount specified by the Issuers and (iii) Exchange Notes
from time to time for issue in exchange for a like principal amount of Initial
Notes or Initial Additional Notes, in each case specified in clauses (i) through
(iii) above, upon a written order of the Issuers signed by an Officer of each of
the Issuers (an "Authentication Order"). Such Authentication Order shall specify
the amount of Notes to be authenticated and the date on which the Notes are to
be authenticated, whether such notes are to be Initial Notes, Additional Notes
or Exchange Notes and whether the Notes are to be issued as one or more Global
Notes and such other information as the Issuers may include or the Trustee may
reasonably request. The aggregate principal amount of Notes which may be
authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.

                                     - 27 -
<PAGE>

         On the Issue Date, the Issuers will issue $550,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of Initial Notes. Initial Notes and any Initial Additional
Notes offered and sold in reliance on the exemption from registration under the
Securities Act provided by Section 4(2) thereunder or Rule 144A shall be issued
as one or more Rule 144A Global Notes. Initial Notes and any Initial Additional
Notes offered and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
shall be issued as one or more Regulation S Global Notes.

         The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the
Issuers to authenticate Notes. An authenticating agent may authenticate Notes
whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to
authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An
authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with Holders or an
Affiliate of the Issuers.

Section 2.03. Registrar, Paying Agent and Calculation Agent.

         The Issuers shall maintain an office or agency where Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an
office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The
Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange.
The Issuers shall maintain the services of a duly-appointed Calculation Agent.
The Issuers may appoint one or more co-registrars, one or more additional paying
agents and one or more additional calculation agents. The term "Registrar"
includes any co-registrar, the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional
paying agent. The Issuers may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Calculation
Agent without notice to any Holder. The Issuers shall notify the Trustee in
writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If
the Issuers fail to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar, Paying
Agent or Calculation Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of
its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.

         The Issuers initially appoint The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") to
act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes.

         The Issuers initially appoint the Trustee to act as the Registrar,
Paying Agent and Calculation Agent and to act as Custodian with respect to the
Global Notes.

Section 2.04. Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.

         The Issuers shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to
agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of
Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, and shall notify the
Trustee of any default by the Issuers in making any such payment. While any such
default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held
by it to the Trustee. The Issuers at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay
all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further
liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it
shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders
all money held by it as Paying Agent. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization
proceedings relating to the Issuers, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for
the Notes.

         The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of
all Holders and shall otherwise comply with TIA ss. 312(a). If the Trustee is
not the Registrar, the Issuers shall furnish to the Trustee at least seven
Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the
Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the
Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of
Notes and the Issuers shall otherwise comply with TIA ss. 312(a).

Section 2.06. Transfer and Exchange.

         (a) Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes. A Global Note may not be
transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary,
by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or to another nominee of the
Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary
or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global Notes shall be exchanged
by the Issuers for Definitive Notes if:

                  (i) the Issuers deliver to the Trustee notice from the
         Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
         Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing agency registered under
         the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not
         appointed by the Issuers within 120 days after the date of such notice
         from the Depositary; or

                  (ii) the Issuers in their sole discretion determine that the
         Global Notes (in whole but not in part) should be exchanged for
         Definitive Notes and deliver a written notice to such effect to the
         Trustee; or

                  (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default or
         Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

         Upon the occurrence of any of the preceding events in (i), (ii) or
(iii) above, Definitive Notes shall be issued in such names as the Depositary
shall instruct the Trustee. Global Notes also may be exchanged or replaced, in
whole or in part, as provided in Sections 2.07 and 2.10. Every Note
authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu of, a Global Note or any
portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 2.06 or Section 2.07 or 2.10, shall be
authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Note. A
Global Note may not be exchanged for another Note other than as provided in this
Section 2.06(a); however, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be
transferred and exchanged as provided in Section 2.06(b), (c) or (f).

         (b) Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in the Global Notes.
The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global Notes shall be
effected through the Depositary, in accordance with the provisions of this
Indenture and the Applicable Procedures. Beneficial interests in the Restricted
Global Notes shall be subject to restrictions on transfer comparable to those
set forth herein to the extent required by the Securities Act. Prior to the
expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period set forth in Regulation
S, beneficial interests in any Regulation S Global Notes may be held only

                                     - 29 -
<PAGE>

through Euroclear or Clearstream unless transferred in accordance with Section
2.06(b)(iii)(A). Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes also
shall require compliance with either subparagraph (i) or (ii) below, as
applicable, as well as one or more of the other following subparagraphs, as
applicable:

                  (i) Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global Note.
         Beneficial interests in any Restricted Global Note may be transferred
         to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial
         interest in the same Restricted Global Note in accordance with the
         transfer restrictions set forth in the Private Placement Legend.
         Beneficial interests in any Unrestricted Global Note may be transferred
         to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial
         interest in an Unrestricted Global Note. No written orders or
         instructions shall be required to be delivered to the Registrar to
         effect the transfers described in this Section 2.06(b)(i).

                  (ii) All Other Transfers and Exchanges of Beneficial Interests
         in Global Notes. In connection with all transfers and exchanges of
         beneficial interests that are not subject to Section 2.06(b)(i) above,
         the transferor of such beneficial interest must deliver to the
         Registrar either:

                           (A) a written order from a Participant or an Indirect
                  Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the
                  Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to credit or
                  cause to be credited a beneficial interest in another Global
                  Note in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be
                  transferred or exchanged; and

                           (B) instructions given in accordance with the
                  Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the
                  Participant account to be credited with such increase; or

                           (C) a written order from a Participant or an Indirect
                  Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the
                  Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to cause to be
                  issued a Definitive Note in an amount equal to the beneficial
                  interest to be transferred or exchanged; and

                           (D) instructions given by the Depositary to the
                  Registrar containing information regarding the Person in whose
                  name such Definitive Note shall be registered to effect the
                  transfer or exchange referred to in (A) above.

Upon consummation of an Exchange Offer by the Issuers in accordance with Section
2.06(f), the requirements of this Section 2.06(b)(ii) shall be deemed to have
been satisfied upon receipt by the Registrar of the instructions contained in
the Letter of Transmittal delivered by the holder of such beneficial interests
in the Restricted Global Notes. Upon satisfaction of all of the requirements for
transfer or exchange of beneficial interests in Global Notes contained in this
Indenture and the Notes or otherwise applicable under the Securities Act, the
Trustee shall adjust the principal amount of the relevant Global Note(s)
pursuant to Section 2.06(h).

                  (iii) Transfer of Beneficial Interests to Another Restricted
         Global Note. A beneficial interest in any Restricted Global Note may be
         transferred to a Person who

                                     - 30 -

         takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another
         Restricted Global Note if the transfer complies with the requirements
         of Section 2.06(b)(ii) above and the Registrar receives the following:

                           (A) if the transferee will take delivery in the form
                  of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note, then
                  the transferor must deliver a certificate in the form of
                  Exhibit B hereto, including the certifications in item (1)
                  thereof; and

         Global Note. A beneficial interest in any Restricted Global Note may be
         exchanged by any holder thereof for a beneficial interest in an
         Unrestricted Global Note or transferred to a Person who takes delivery
         thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global
         Note if the exchange or transfer complies with the requirements of
         Section 2.06(b)(ii) above and:

                           (A) such exchange or transfer is effected pursuant to
                  an Exchange Offer in accordance with a Registration Rights
                  Agreement and the holder of the beneficial interest to be
                  transferred, in the case of an exchange, or the transferee, in
                  the case of a transfer, certifies in the applicable Letter of
                  Transmittal that it is not (1) a broker- dealer, (2) a Person
                  participating in the distribution of the relevant Exchange

                  expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period set

                  following:

                                    (1) if the holder of such beneficial
                           interest in a Restricted Global Note proposes to
                           exchange such beneficial interest for a beneficial
                           interest in an Unrestricted Global Note, a
                           certificate from such holder in the form of Exhibit C
                           hereto, including the certifications in item (1)(a)

                           who shall take delivery thereof in the form of a
                           beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Note, a
                           certificate from such holder in the form of Exhibit B

                  and, in each such case set forth in this subparagraph (D), if
                  the Registrar so requests or if the Applicable Procedures so
                  require, an Opinion of Counsel in form reasonably acceptable
                  to the Registrar to the effect that such exchange or transfer
                  is in compliance with the Securities Act and that the
                  restrictions on transfer contained herein and in the Private
                  Placement Legend are no longer required in order to maintain
                  compliance with the Securities Act.

                  If any such transfer is effected pursuant to subparagraph (B)
         or (D) above at a time when an Unrestricted Global Note has not yet
         been issued, the Issuers shall issue and, upon receipt of an
         Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02, the Trustee shall

         principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of beneficial
         interests transferred pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (D) above.

         interest to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a
         Restricted Definitive Note, then, upon receipt by the Registrar of the

                  such holder in the form of Exhibit C hereto, including the

         is in compliance with the Securities Act and that the restrictions on
         transfer contained herein and in the Private Placement Legend are no
         longer required in order to maintain compliance with the Securities
         Act.

                  (iii) Unrestricted Definitive Notes to Unrestricted Definitive
         Notes. A Holder of Unrestricted Definitive Notes may transfer such
         Notes to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of an
         Unrestricted Definitive Note. Upon receipt of a request to register
         such a transfer, the Registrar shall register the Unrestricted
         Definitive Notes pursuant to the instructions from the Holder thereof.

         (f) Exchange Offer. Upon the occurrence of an Exchange Offer in
accordance with a Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers shall issue and,
upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02, the
Trustee shall authenticate (i) one or more Unrestricted Global Notes in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial
interests in the Restricted Global Notes tendered for acceptance by

to be reduced accordingly, and the Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the Persons designated by the Holders of Definitive
Notes so accepted Definitive Notes in the appropriate principal amount.

         REQUEST OF THE HOLDER AFTER THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE."

                           (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Global Note or

                  (ii) Regulation S Legend. Each temporary Regulation S Global
         Note should bear a legend in substantially the following form:

         "THE ISSUERS HAVE REQUESTED THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY NOT TO
         TRANSFER ANY INTEREST IN THIS GLOBAL NOTE BY EFFECTING BOOK-ENTRY

         COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S OR TO A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN
         ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN EACH CASE IN
         ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSFER PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2 OF THE
         INDENTURE."

         (h) Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Notes. At such time as all
beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been exchanged for
Definitive Notes or a particular Global Note has been redeemed, repurchased or
canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note shall be returned to or
retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.11. At any
time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is
exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the
form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for Definitive Notes,
the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be reduced
accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by the Trustee
or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction;
and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person
who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another
Global Note, such other Global Note shall be increased accordingly and an
endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the
Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase.

         (i) General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges.

                  (i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the
         Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes
         and Definitive Notes upon the Issuers' order or at the Registrar's
         request.

                  (ii) No service charge shall be made to a holder of a
         beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive
         Note for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuers may
         require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or
         similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than
         any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon
         exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.09, 4.11, 4.16 and
         9.05).

                  (iii) The Registrar shall not be required to register the
         transfer of or exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in
         part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

                  (iv) All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any
         registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive
         Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Issuers, evidencing the
         same debt, and entitled to the same benefits

                                     - 41 -
<PAGE>

         under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes
         surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

                  (v) The Issuers shall not be required to register the transfer
         of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next succeeding
         Interest Payment Date.

                  (vi) Prior to due presentment for the registration of a
         transfer of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Issuers may deem
         and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the
         absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of
         principal of and interest on such Notes and for all other purposes, and
         none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Issuers shall be affected by
         notice to the contrary.

                  (vii) The Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and
         Definitive Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02.

                  (viii) All certifications, certificates and Opinions of
         Counsel required to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this
         Section 2.06 to effect a registration of transfer or exchange may be
         submitted by facsimile.

Section 2.07. Replacement Notes.

         If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or the Issuers and
the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Note, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee's
requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Issuers, an indemnity
bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the
Trustee and the Issuers to protect the Issuers, the Trustee, any Agent and any
authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is
replaced. The Issuers may charge for their expenses in replacing a Note.

         Every replacement Note is an additional legally binding obligation of
the Issuers and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture
equally and proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

Section 2.08. Outstanding Notes.

         The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by
the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for
cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the
Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, and those described
in this Section as not outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 2.09, a Note
does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the
Company holds the Note.

         If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be
outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the
replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser.

                                     - 42 -
<PAGE>

         If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section
4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.

         If the Paying Agent (other than an Issuer, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate
of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient
to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes shall
be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall cease to accrue interest.

Section 2.09. Treasury Notes.

         In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of
Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by an
Issuer, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or
under direct or indirect common control with an Issuer, shall be considered as
though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent,
only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be
so disregarded.

Section 2.10. Temporary Notes.

         Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the
Issuers may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order,
shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in
the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Issuers
considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Issuers shall prepare and the
Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes.

         Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the benefits of
this Indenture.

Section 2.11. Cancellation.

         The Issuers at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for
cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any
Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The
Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of
transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall dispose of
such canceled Notes in its customary manner. The Issuers may not issue new Notes
to replace Notes that they have paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation.

Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest.

         If the Issuers default in a payment of interest on the Notes, they
shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent
lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are
Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided
in the Notes and in Section 4.01. The Issuers shall notify the Trustee in
writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and
the date of the proposed payment. The Issuers shall fix or cause to be fixed
each such special record date and payment date; provided that no such special
record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for
such defaulted interest. At least 15 days

                                     - 43 -
<PAGE>

before the special record date, the Issuers (or, upon the written request of the
Issuers, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuers) shall mail
or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states the special record date,
the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.

                            REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT

Section 3.01. Notices to Trustee.

         If the Issuers elect to redeem Notes pursuant to the optional
redemption provisions of Section 3.07, they shall furnish to the Trustee, at
least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, an Officers'
Certificate setting forth (i) the clause of this Indenture pursuant to which the
redemption shall occur, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the principal amount of
Notes to be redeemed and (iv) the redemption price.

Section 3.02. Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed.

         If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an
offer to purchase at any time, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed
or purchased among the Holders of the Notes in compliance with the requirements
of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are
listed or, if the Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or in
accordance with any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. In
the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Notes to be redeemed
shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee from the outstanding
Notes not previously called for redemption.

         The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuers in writing of the Notes
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes and portions of
Notes selected shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000;
except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire
outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of
$1,000, shall be redeemed. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also
apply to portions of Notes called for redemption.

Section 3.03. Notice of Redemption.

         Subject to the provisions of Section 3.09, at least 30 days but not
more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Issuers shall mail or cause to
be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose
Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address.

         The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

                  (a) the redemption date;

                                     - 44 -
<PAGE>

                  (b) the redemption price;

                  (c) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
         principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the
         redemption date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in
         principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon
         cancellation of the original Note;

                  (d) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

                  (e) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to
         the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;

                  (f) that, unless the Issuers default in making such redemption
         payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on
         and after the redemption date;

                  (g) the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this
         Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being
         redeemed; and

                  (h) that no representation is made as to the correctness or
         accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed
         on the Notes.

         At the Issuers' request, the Trustee shall give the notice of
redemption in the Issuers' name and at their expense; provided, however, that
each of the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee, at least 45 days prior
to the redemption date, an Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee
give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice
as provided in the preceding paragraph.

Section 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption.

         Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03,
Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption
date at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be conditional.

Section 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.

         At or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the redemption date,
the Issuers shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent money
sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Notes to
be redeemed on that date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall promptly return
to the Issuers any money deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the
Issuers in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the redemption price of, and
accrued interest on, all Notes to be redeemed.

         If the Issuers comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraph,
on and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or
the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is redeemed on or after
an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date,
then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name
such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any
Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption

                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>

because of the failure of the Issuers to comply with the preceding paragraph,
interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until
such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on
such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in
Section 4.01.

Section 3.06. Notes Redeemed in Part.

         Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Issuers shall
issue and, upon the Issuers' written request, the Trustee shall authenticate for
the Holder at the expense of the Issuers a new Note equal in principal amount to
the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.

Section 3.07. Optional Redemption.

                  (a) Except as set forth in clause (b) of this Section 3.07,
         the Issuers shall not have the option to redeem the Notes pursuant to
         this Section 3.07 prior to December 15, 2006. Thereafter, the Issuers
         shall have the option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon
         not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption
         prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below
         plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the applicable
         redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning
         on December 15 of the years indicated below:

</TABLE>

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this
         Section 3.07, at any time prior to December 15, 2006, the Issuers may,
         on any one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the original
         aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the principal amount
         of any Additional Notes) issued under this Indenture on a pro rata
         basis (or nearly as pro rata as practicable) at a redemption price of
         100.00% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium equal to the
         interest rate per annum applicable to the Notes on the date the notice
         of redemption is given, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
         redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity
         Offerings; provided that:

                           (i) at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
                  amount of Notes (including the principal amount of any
                  Additional Notes) issued under this Indenture remains
                  outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such
                  redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its
                  Subsidiaries); and

the provisions of Section 3.01 through 3.06.

Section 3.08. Mandatory Redemption.

         Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.11 or Section 4.16 below, the
Issuers shall not be required to make mandatory redemption payments with respect
to the Notes.

Section 3.09. Offer to Purchase by Application of Excess Proceeds.

         In the event that the Issuers shall be required to commence an offer to
all Holders to purchase Notes pursuant to Section 4.11 (an "Asset Sale Offer"),
they shall follow the procedures specified below.

         The Asset Sale Offer shall remain open for a period of 20 Business Days
following its commencement and no longer, except to the extent that a longer
period is required by applicable law (the "Offer Period"). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Offer Period (the "Purchase Date"),
the Issuers shall purchase the principal amount of Notes required to be
purchased pursuant to Section 4.11 (the "Offer Amount") or, if less than the
Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to the Asset Sale
Offer. Payment for any Notes so purchased shall be made in the same manner as
interest payments are made. Unless the Issuers default in making such payment,
any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer shall cease to
accrue interest after the Purchase Date.

         If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or
before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest shall
be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of
business on such record date, and no Special Interest shall be payable to
Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

         Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer the Issuers shall send, by
first class mail, a notice to the Trustee and each of the Holders, with a copy
to the Trustee. The notice shall contain all instructions and materials
necessary to enable such Holders to tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale
Offer. The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders. The notice, which
shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, shall state:

                  (a) that the Asset Sale Offer is being made pursuant to this
         Section 3.09 and Section 4.11 and the length of time the Asset Sale
         Offer shall remain open;

                  (b) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase
         Date;

                  (c) that any Note not tendered or accepted for payment shall
         continue to accrue interest;

                  (d) that, unless the Issuers default in making such payment,
         any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer shall
         cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;

                  (e) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to
         an Asset Sale Offer or may elect to have Notes purchased in integral
         multiples of $1,000 only;

                  (f) that Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to
         any Asset Sale Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the
         form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of
         the Note completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Issuers,
         a depositary, if appointed by the Issuers, or a Paying Agent at the
         address specified in the notice at least three days before the Purchase
         Date;

                  (g) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election
         if the Issuers, the depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
         receives, not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a
         telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the
         name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the Holder
         delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing
         his election to have such Note purchased;

                  (h) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes
         surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Issuers shall
         select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such
         adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Issuers so that only
         Notes in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall
         be purchased); and

                  (i) that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part shall
         be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
         portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry
         transfer).

         On or before the Purchase Date, the Issuers shall, to the extent
lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the
Offer Amount of Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale
Offer or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered,
and shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such
Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuers in accordance
with the terms of this Section 3.09. The Issuers, the Depositary or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than five
days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount
equal to the purchase price of the Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by
the Issuers for purchase, and the Issuers shall promptly issue a new Note, and
the Trustee, upon written request from the Issuers, shall authenticate and mail
or deliver such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Any Note not so accepted shall be
promptly mailed or delivered by the Issuers to the Holder thereof. The Issuers
shall publicly announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase
Date.

         Other than as specifically provided in this Section 3.09, any purchase
pursuant to this Section 3.09 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 3.01 through 3.06.

Section 4.01. Payment of Notes.

         The Issuers shall pay or cause to be paid the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on the Notes on the dates and in the manner provided in the
Notes. Principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be considered paid on the
date due if the Paying Agent, if other than the Issuers or a Subsidiary thereof,
holds as of 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the due date money deposited by the
Issuers in immediately available funds and designated for and sufficient to pay
all principal, premium, if any, and interest then due. The Issuers shall pay all
Special Interest, if any, in the same manner on the dates and in the amounts set

2% per annum in excess of the then applicable interest rate on the Notes to the

lawful.

Section 4.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and demands to or
upon the Issuers in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The
Issuers shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any
change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Issuers
shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee.

         The Issuers may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or
all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided,
however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the
Issuers of their obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York for such purposes. The Issuers shall give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any
change in the location of any such other office or agency.

         existence thereof, it being understood that such accountants shall not
         be liable directly or indirectly to any Person for any failure to
         obtain knowledge of any such violation. In the event that, after the
         Issuers have used their reasonable best efforts to obtain the written
         statement of the Company's independent public accountants required by

         have used their reasonable best efforts to obtain such required
         statement but were unable to do so and (ii) attaching the written
         statement of the Company's accountants that the Company received in
         lieu thereof.

         (3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries.

         However, the preceding restrictions shall not apply to encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

         (1) Existing Indebtedness as in effect on the Issue Date (including,
without limitation, Indebtedness under any of the Credit Facilities) and any
amendments,

                                     - 55 -
<PAGE>

modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings thereof, provided that such amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, with
respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in
the most restrictive Existing Indebtedness, as in effect on the Issue Date;

         (2) this Indenture and the Notes;

         (3) applicable law;

         (4) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person
acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at
the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was
incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or
assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the
Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such
Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of this Indenture to be incurred;

         (5) customary non-assignment provisions in leases, franchise agreements
and other commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practices;

         (6) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary
course of business that impose restrictions on the property so acquired of the
nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

         (7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company that restricts distributions by such Restricted
Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

         (8) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions
contained in the agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the
agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

         (9) Liens securing Indebtedness or other obligations otherwise
permitted to be incurred under Section 4.14 that limit the right of the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to dispose of the assets subject to such
Lien;

         (10) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of
assets or property in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

         (11) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

         (12) restrictions contained in the terms of Indebtedness permitted to
be incurred under Section 4.10; provided that such restrictions are no more
restrictive, taken as a whole,

                                     - 56 -
<PAGE>

than the terms contained in the most restrictive, together or individually of
the Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date; and

         (13) restrictions that are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, than customary provisions in comparable financings and that the
management of the Company determines, at the time of such financing, will not
materially impair the Issuers' ability to make payments as required under the
Notes.

Section 4.10. Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.

         The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee
or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise,
with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Debt) and the Company shall not issue any Disqualified Stock and shall not
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, provided that the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness, the Company may issue Disqualified Stock
and subject to the final paragraph of this covenant below, Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Company may incur Preferred Stock if the Leverage Ratio of
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been not greater than 4.5
to 1.0 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the
net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or
the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be,
at the beginning of the most recently ended fiscal quarter.

         So long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would be
caused thereby, the first paragraph of this covenant shall not prohibit the
incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively,
"Permitted Debt"):

         (1) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities; provided that the aggregate principal
amount of all Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
outstanding under this clause (1) for all Credit Facilities of the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries after giving effect to such incurrence does not
exceed an amount equal to $9.75 billion less the aggregate amount of all Net
Proceeds from Asset Sales applied by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to repay Indebtedness under a Credit Facility pursuant to Section
4.11.

         (2) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of
Existing Indebtedness (other than under the Credit Facilities);

         (3) the incurrence on the Issue Date by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional
Notes);

         (4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or
purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing
all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement
(including, without limitation, the cost of design, development, construction,
acquisition, transportation, installation, improvement, and migration) of
Productive Assets of the Company or any of its Restricted

                                     - 57 -
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75 million at any
time outstanding pursuant to this clause (4);

         (5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of
which are used to refund, refinance or replace, in whole or in part,
Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by this
Indenture to be incurred under this clause (5), the first paragraph of this
covenant or clauses (2) or (3) of this paragraph;

         (6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that:

                  (a) if the Company is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such
         Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in
         full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Notes; and

                  (b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity
         Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person
         other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof and (ii) any
         sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not
         either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof, shall be deemed,
         in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness that was
         not permitted by this clause (6);

         (7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of Hedging Obligations that are incurred for the purpose of fixing or hedging
interest rate risk with respect to any floating rate Indebtedness that is
permitted by the terms of this Indenture to be outstanding;

         (8) the guarantee by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that was permitted to
be incurred by another provision of this Section 4.10;

         (9) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding under this clause (9), not to exceed $300 million; and

         (10) the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the
write up of Indebtedness in accordance with purchase accounting.

         For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.10, any
Indebtedness under Credit Facilities outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
deemed to have been incurred pursuant to clause (1) above and, in the event that
an item of proposed Indebtedness (other than any Indebtedness initially deemed
on the Issue Date to be incurred under clause (1) above) (a) meets the criteria
of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1)
through (10) above or (b) is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall be permitted to classify and from
time to time to reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies
with this covenant. Once any item of Indebtedness is so reclassified, it shall
no longer be deemed outstanding

                                     - 58 -
<PAGE>

under the category of Permitted Debt, where initially incurred or previously
reclassified. For avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a single
agreement, instrument, program, facility or line of credit may be classified as
Indebtedness arising in part under one of the clauses listed above or under the
first paragraph of this covenant, and in part under any one or more of the
clauses listed above, to the extent that such Indebtedness satisfies the
criteria for such classification.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company consummate a Subordinated Debt Financing or a
Preferred Stock Financing. A "Subordinated Debt Financing" or a "Preferred Stock
Financing," as the case may be, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company shall mean a public offering or private placement (whether pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act or otherwise) of Subordinated Notes or
Preferred Stock (whether or not such Preferred Stock constitutes Disqualified
Stock), as the case may be, of such Restricted Subsidiary to one or more
purchasers (other than to one or more Affiliates of the Company). "Subordinated
Notes" with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company shall mean
Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary that is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to any other Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary
(including, without limitation, Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities). The
foregoing limitation shall not apply to

                  (a) any Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of any Person existing
         at the time such Person is merged with or into or becomes a Subsidiary
         of the Company; provided that such Indebtedness or Preferred Stock was
         not incurred or issued in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
         Person merging with or into, or becoming a Subsidiary of, the Company,
         and

                  (b) any Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of a Restricted
         Subsidiary issued in connection with, and as part of the consideration
         for, an acquisition, whether by stock purchase, asset sale, merger or
         otherwise, in each case involving such Restricted Subsidiary, which
         Indebtedness or Preferred Stock is issued to the seller or sellers of
         such stock or assets; provided that such Restricted Subsidiary is not
         obligated to register such Indebtedness or Preferred Stock under the
         Securities Act or obligated to provide information pursuant to Rule
         144A under the Securities Act.

Section 4.11. Limitation on Asset Sales.

         The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

         (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at
the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the
assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of;

         (2) such fair market value is determined by the Board of Directors of
the Company and evidenced by a resolution of such Board of Directors set forth
in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee; and

                                     - 59 -
<PAGE>

         (3) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or
readily marketable securities.

         For purposes of this Section 4.11, each of the following shall be
deemed to be cash:

                  (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such
         Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet) of the Company or
         any Restricted Subsidiary thereof (other than contingent liabilities
         and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that
         are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a
         customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such
         Restricted Subsidiary from further liability;

                  (b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the
         Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are
         converted by the recipient thereof into cash, Cash Equivalents or
         readily marketable securities within 60 days after receipt thereof (to
         the extent of the cash, Cash Equivalents or readily marketable
         securities received in that conversion); and

                  (c) Productive Assets.

         Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset
Sale, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof may apply an amount equal
to such Net Proceeds at its option:

         (1) to repay debt under the Credit Facilities or any other Indebtedness
of the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than Indebtedness
represented solely by a guarantee of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company); or

         (2) to invest in Productive Assets; provided that any such amount of
Net Proceeds which the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof has committed
to invest in Productive Assets within 365 days of the applicable Asset Sale may
be invested in Productive Assets within two years of such Asset Sale.

         The amount of any Net Proceeds received from Asset Sales that are not
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph shall constitute
"Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25
million, the Company shall make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders of Notes and
all holders of other Indebtedness that is of equal priority with the Notes
containing provisions requiring offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds
of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such
other Indebtedness of equal priority that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, which amount includes the entire amount of the Net Proceeds. The offer
price in any Asset Sale Offer shall be payable in cash and equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the subject Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date of purchase. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such
other Indebtedness of equal priority tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority to be purchased on a pro rata basis.

                                     - 60 -
<PAGE>

         If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale
Offer, then the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof may use such
remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this
Indenture. Upon completion of any Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

         In the event that the Company shall be required to commence an offer to
Holders to purchase Notes pursuant to this Section 4.11, it shall follow the
procedures specified in Sections 3.01 through 3.09.

Section 4.12. Sale and Leaseback Transactions.

         The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, enter into any sale and leaseback transaction; provided that
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may enter into a sale and leaseback
transaction if:

         (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could have

                  (a) incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the
         Attributable Debt relating to such sale and leaseback transaction under
         the Leverage Ratio test in the first paragraph of Section 4.10 and

                  (b) incurred a Lien to secure such Indebtedness pursuant to
         Section 4.14 or the definition of Permitted Liens; and

         (2) the transfer of assets in that sale and leaseback transaction is
permitted by, and the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary applies the proceeds
of such transaction in compliance with, Section 4.11.

         The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to a sale and leaseback
transaction if the lease is for a period, including renewal rights, of not in
excess of three years.

Section 4.13. Transactions with Affiliates.

         The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract,
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless:

         (1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable
to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have
been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

         (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee:

                  (a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
         related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration given
         or received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary in excess
         of $15 million, a resolution of the Board of

                                     - 61 -
<PAGE>

         Directors of the Company or CCI set forth in an Officers' Certificate
         certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this Section
         4.13 and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a
         majority of the members of such Board of Directors; and

                  (b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of
         related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration given
         or received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in excess of
         $50 million, an opinion as to the fairness to the Holders of such
         Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by an
         accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing.

         The following items shall not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions
and, therefore, shall not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

         (1) any existing employment agreement entered into by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any employment agreement entered into by the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with the past practice of the Company or any Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary;

         (2) transactions between or among the Company and/or its Restricted
Subsidiaries;

         (3) payment of reasonable directors fees to Persons who are not
otherwise Affiliates of the Company and customary indemnification and insurance
arrangements in favor of directors, regardless of affiliation with the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

         (4) payment of Management Fees;

         (5) Restricted Payments that are permitted by Section 4.07 and
Restricted Investments that are permitted by Section 4.08;

         (6) Permitted Investments; and

         (7) transactions pursuant to agreements existing on the Issue Date, as
in effect on the Issue Date, or as subsequently modified, supplemented, or
amended, to the extent that any such modifications, supplements or amendments
complied with the applicable provisions of the first paragraph of this Section
4.13.

Section 4.14. Liens.

         The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness, Attributable Debt or
trade payables on any asset of the Company, whether owned on the Issue Date or
thereafter acquired, except Permitted Liens.

                                     - 62 -

Section 4.15. Existence.

         Subject to Article 5, the Company shall do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect (i) its limited
liability company existence, and the corporate, partnership or other existence
of each of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational
documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of the Company or any
such Subsidiary and (ii) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and
franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise,
or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Capital Corp), if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the
loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes.

Section 4.16. Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control.

         If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder of Notes shall have the
right to require the Issuers to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or
an integral multiple thereof) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to a "Change of
Control Offer." In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuers shall offer a
"Change of Control Payment" in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to
the date of purchase.

         Within ten days following any Change of Control, the Issuers shall mail
a notice to each Holder (with a copy to the Trustee) describing the transaction
or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and stating:

         (1) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall not exceed 30
Business Days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control
Payment Date");

         (2) that any Note not tendered shall continue to accrue interest;

         (3) that, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of
Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment
Date;

         (4) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the Notes, with the form
entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes
completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to
the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control
Payment Date;

         (5) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the
Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex,
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the
principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such
Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes purchased; and

                                     - 63 -
<PAGE>

         (6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part shall be
issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $1,000 in
principal amount or an integral multiple thereof.

         The Issuers shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act (or any successor rules) and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with the provisions of this Section 4.16, the Issuers' compliance with such laws
and regulations shall not in and of itself cause a breach of their obligations
under this Section 4.16.

         On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers shall, to the extent
lawful:

         (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

         (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of
Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

         (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so
accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuers.

         The Paying Agent shall promptly pay to each Holder of Notes so tendered
the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder
a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note shall be in a principal
amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Issuers shall publicly
announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable
after the Change of Control Payment Date.

         The provisions described above that require the Issuers to make a
Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control shall be applicable
regardless of whether or not any other provisions in this Indenture are
applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, this
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to
require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.16, the Issuers
shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control
if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Section 4.17. Limitations on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness.

         The Company shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to Guarantee or pledge any assets to secure the payment
of any other Indebtedness of the Company except in respect of the Credit
Facilities (the "Guaranteed Indebtedness") unless:

         (1) such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a
supplemental indenture providing for the Guarantee (a "Subsidiary Guarantee") of
the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary and

         (2) until one year after all the Notes have been paid in full in cash,
such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or
subrogation or any other rights against the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary thereof as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary
under its Subsidiary Guarantee; provided that this paragraph shall not be
applicable to any Guarantee or any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the
time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary.

         If the Guaranteed Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes, then the
Guarantee of such Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the
Subsidiary Guarantee at least to the extent that the Guaranteed Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes.

Section 4.18. Payments for Consent.

         The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the
benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Notes
unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of
the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in
the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

Section 4.19. Application of Fall-Away Covenants.

         During any period of time that (a) the Notes have Investment Grade
Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (b) no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall
not be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12,
4.13 and clause (D) of the first paragraph of Section 5.01 (collectively, the
"Suspended Covenants").

         If the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the
Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the previous sentence
and, subsequently, one, or both of the Rating Agencies withdraws its ratings or
downgrades the ratings assigned to the Notes below the required Investment Grade
Ratings or a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants. The ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
to make Restricted Payments after the time of such withdrawal, downgrade,
Default or Event of Default shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of
Section 4.07

                                     - 65 -

as though such covenant had been in effect during the entire period of time from
the Issue Date.

agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

         (C) immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default

such consolidation or into which either Issuer is merged or to which such
transfer is made shall succeed to and (except in the case of a lease) be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, such Issuer under

respect to any obligations that arise from, or are related to, such transaction.

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

Section 6.01. Events of Default.

         Each of the following is an "Event of Default" with respect to the
Notes:

         (1) default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest
on the Notes;

         (2) default in payment when due of the principal of or premium, if any,
on the Notes;

         (3) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
comply with the provisions of Sections 4.16 or 5.01;

         (4) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 30
consecutive days after written notice thereof has been given to the Issuers by
the Trustee or to the Issuers and the Trustee by Holders of at least 25% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding to comply with any of their
other covenants or agreements in this Indenture;

         (5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which
there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any
Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created
after the Issue Date, if that default:

                  (a) is caused by a failure to pay at final stated maturity the
         principal amount on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the
         grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default
         (a "Payment Default"); or

                                     - 67 -
<PAGE>

                  (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to
         its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with
the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
$100 million or more;

         (6) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay
final judgments which are non-appealable aggregating in excess of $100 million,
net of applicable insurance which has not been denied in writing by the insurer,
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days; and

         (7) the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to or
within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law:

                  (a) commences a voluntary case,

                  (b) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in
         an involuntary case,

                  (c) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for
         all or substantially all of its property, or

                  (d) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its
         creditors; or

         (8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under
any Bankruptcy Law that:

                  (a) is for relief against the Company or any of its
         Significant Subsidiaries in an involuntary case;

                  (b) appoints a custodian of the Company or any of its
         Significant Subsidiaries or for all or substantially all of the
         property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or

                  (c) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its
         Significant Subsidiaries;

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days.

Section 6.02. Acceleration.

         In the case of an Event of Default arising from clause (7) or (8) of
Section 6.01 with respect to the Company, all outstanding Notes shall become due
and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuers or the
Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by
notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare all the Notes to be due and
payable immediately. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all
of the

                                     - 68 -
<PAGE>

Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default
(except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely
because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.

Section 6.03. Other Remedies.

         If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue
any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the
Notes or this Indenture.

         The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any
of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or
omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.04. Waiver of Existing Defaults.

         Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders
of all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes
(including in connection with an offer to purchase) (provided, however, that the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related
payment default that resulted from such acceleration). Upon any such waiver,
such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom
shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 6.05. Control by Majority.

         Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power
conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be
prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the
Trustee in personal liability. The Trustee may take any other action which it
deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such directive.

Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits.

         A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture
or the Notes only if:

                  (a) the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice
         of a continuing Event of Default;

                                     - 69 -
<PAGE>

                  (b) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
         then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue
         the remedy;

                  (c) such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and, if
         requested, provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee
         against any loss, liability or expense;

                  (d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60
         days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the
         provision of indemnity; and

                  (e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in
         principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee
         a direction inconsistent with the request.

         A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights
of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another
Holder of a Note.

Section 6.07. Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any
Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest
on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note
(including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be
impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee.

         If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and
as trustee of an express trust against the Issuers for the whole amount of
principal of, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and
interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

         The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers
or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the
Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuers
(or any other obligor upon the Notes), their creditors or their property and
shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or
other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in
any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such
payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the
making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any
amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Trustee under Section 7.07. To the extent that the payment

                                     - 70 -
<PAGE>

of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07
out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason,
payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any
and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that
the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation
or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or
accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to
authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such
proceeding.

Section 6.10. Priorities.

         If the Trustee collects any money or other property pursuant to this
Article, it shall pay out the money and other property in the following order:

         First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under
         Section 7.07, including payment of all compensation, expense and
         liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the
         costs and expenses of collection;

         Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for
         principal, premium, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference
         or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on
         the Notes for principal, premium, if any and interest, respectively;
         and

         Third: to the Issuers or to such party as a court of competent
         jurisdiction shall direct.

         The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to
Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.

Section 6.11. Undertaking for Costs.

         In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by
it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party
litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the
court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due
regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party
litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a
Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by Holders of more than 10%
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee.

         (1) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee
shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and
use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own
affairs.

         (2) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

                  (a) the duties of the Trustee shall be determined solely by
         the express provisions of this Indenture and the Trustee need perform
         only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and
         no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into
         this Indenture against the Trustee; and

                  (b) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
         conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
         correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or
         opinions required to be furnished to the Trustee hereunder and
         conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee
         shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not
         they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not
         confirm or investigate the accuracy of any mathematical calculations or
         other facts stated therein).

         (3) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own gross
negligent action, its own gross negligent failure to act, or its own willful
misconduct, except that:

                  (a) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (2)
         of this Section;

                  (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment
         made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that
         the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
         and

                  (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
         it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction
         received by it pursuant to Section 6.05.

         (4) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of
this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs
(1), (2), and (3) of this Section 7.01.

         (5) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend
or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee shall be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights and powers under this Indenture at the
request of any Holders, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee
security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, claim,
damage or expense.

                                     - 72 -
<PAGE>

         (6) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received
by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuers. Money held in
trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the
extent required by law.

         (7) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the
facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or
other paper or documents.

Section 7.02. Rights of Trustee.

         (1) The Trustee may conclusively rely upon any document (whether in its
original or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed
or presented by the proper Person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or
matter stated in the document.

         (2) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an
Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee shall not be
liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on
such Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee may consult with
counsel of its own selection and the written advice or opinion of such counsel
or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and
protection from liability in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by
it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

         (3) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall not
be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due
care.

         (4) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to
take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within the rights or
powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.

         (5) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any
demand, request, direction or notice from either of the Issuers shall be
sufficient if signed by an Officer of such Issuer.

         (6) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of
any of the Holders unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee
reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses
and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction.

         (7) The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default or
Event of Default unless either (a) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall
have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or (b) written notice
of such Default or Event of Default shall have been given to and received by a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee by the Issuers or any Holder.

Section 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee.

         The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the
owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or any
Affiliate of the Issuers with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting
interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for
permission to continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like
rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

Section 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer.

         The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as
to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be
accountable for the Issuers' use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money
paid to the Issuers or upon the Issuers' direction under any provision of this
Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money
received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be
responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or
any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this
Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.

Section 7.05. Notice of Defaults.

         If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is
known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders
of Notes a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after the
Trustee acquires knowledge thereof. Except in the case of a Default or Event of
Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note,
the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its
Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in
the interests of the Holders of the Notes.

Section 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders of the Notes.

         By May 15th of each year, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding,
the Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report dated as of
such reporting date that complies with TIA ss. 313(a) (but if no event described
in TIA ss. 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting
date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA ss.
313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by
TIA ss. 313(c).

         A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of
Notes shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each stock
exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA ss. 313(d). The
Issuers shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock
exchange.

Section 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity.

         The Issuers shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder. The
Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a
trustee of an express trust. The Issuers shall

                                     - 74 -
<PAGE>

reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements,
advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for
its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation,
disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.

         The Issuers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Trustee against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by it arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this
Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against
the Issuers (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim
(whether asserted by the Issuers or any Holder or any other person) or liability
in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties
hereunder, except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be
attributable to its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Trustee shall
notify the Issuers promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity.
Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Issuers shall not relieve the Issuers of
their obligations hereunder. The Issuers shall defend the claim and the Trustee
shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the
Issuers shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Issuers
need not pay for any settlement made without their consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

         The obligations of the Issuers this Section 7.07 shall survive
resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture.

         To secure the Issuers' payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee
shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected
by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on
particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Trustee and the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

         When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and
counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any
Bankruptcy Law.

         The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA ss. 313(b)(2) to
the extent applicable.

Section 7.08. Replacement of Trustee.

         A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of
appointment as provided in this Section.

         The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from
the trust hereby created by so notifying the Issuers. The Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so
notifying the Trustee and the Issuers in writing. The Issuers may remove the
Trustee if:

                  (a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

                                     - 75 -
<PAGE>

                  (b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an
         order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any
         Bankruptcy Law;

                  (c) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee
         or its property; or

                  (d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

         If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the
office of Trustee for any reason, the Issuers shall promptly appoint a successor
Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a
successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Issuers.

         If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Issuers, or
the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may petition at the expense of the Issuers any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

         If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a
Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

         A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuers. Thereupon, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the
successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee
under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its
succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property
held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee; provided all sums owing to the
Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section
7.07. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08,
the Issuers' obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of
the retiring Trustee.

Section 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.

         If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all
or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation,
the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor
Trustee.

Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification.

         There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is a corporation
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trustee power, that is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $100 million
as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.

                                     - 76 -
<PAGE>

This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA
ss. 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee is subject to TIA ss. 310(b).

Section 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Issuers.

         The Trustee is subject to TIA ss. 311(a), excluding any creditor
relationship listed in TIA ss. 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been
removed shall be subject to TIA ss. 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

                    LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE

Section 8.01. Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

         The Issuers may, at the option of their respective boards of directors
or the Board of Directors of CCI evidenced by a resolution set forth in an
Officers' Certificate of each of the Issuers, at any time, elect to have either
Section 8.02 or 8.03 be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with
the conditions set forth below in this Article 8.

Section 8.02. Legal Defeasance and Discharge.

         Upon the Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable
to this Section 8.02, the Issuers shall, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.04, be deemed to have been discharged from
their obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes on the date the
conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For
this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers shall be deemed to have
paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding
Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the
purposes of Section 8.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in
(a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such
Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of
the Issuers, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except
for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or
discharged hereunder:

                  (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive
         payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest
         on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to
         below;

                  (b) the Issuers' obligations with respect to the Notes
         concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated,
         destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or
         agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

                  (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the
         Trustee and the Issuers' obligations in connection therewith; and

                  (d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of this Indenture.

                                     - 77 -
<PAGE>

         Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Issuers may exercise
their option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of their
option under Section 8.03.

Section 8.03. Covenant Defeasance.

         Upon the Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable
to this Section 8.03, the Issuers shall, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.04, be released from their obligations under
the covenants contained in Article 5 and Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10,
4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16, 4.17 and 4.19 with respect to the outstanding
Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 are
satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes shall thereafter
be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent
or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in
connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding"
for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not
be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant
Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Issuers may
omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term,
condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or
indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or
by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or
in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default
or an Event of Default under Section 6.01, but, except as specified above, the
remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby. In
addition, upon the Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable
to this Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.04, Sections 6.01(3) through 6.01(6) shall not constitute Events of
Default.

Section 8.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.

         The following shall be the conditions to the application of either
Section 8.02 or 8.03 to the outstanding Notes:

         In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

         (1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust,
for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date,
as the case may be, and the Issuers must specify whether the Notes are being
defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

         (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered
to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
confirming that

                  (a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been
         published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or

                  (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the
         applicable federal income tax law,

                                     - 78 -
<PAGE>

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel
shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

         (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have
delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

         (4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing either:

                  (a) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event
         of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
         deposit); or

                  (b) insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency
         events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day
         after the date of deposit;

         (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or
instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;

         (6) the Issuers must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day, assuming no intervening
bankruptcy, that no Holder is an insider of either of the Issuers following the
deposit and that such deposit would not be deemed by a court of competent
jurisdiction a transfer for the benefit of either Issuer in its capacity as
such, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally;

         (7) the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuers with the intent of
preferring the Holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuers with
the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the
Issuers or others; and

         (8) the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating
to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by
clause (2) above with respect to a Legal Defeasance need not be delivered if all
Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation

                  (a) have become due and payable or

                                     - 79 -
<PAGE>

                  (b) will become due and payable on the maturity date within
         one year, by their terms or under arrangements satisfactory to the
         Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the
         name, and at the expense, of the Issuers.

Section 8.05. Deposited Money and Government Securities to Be Held in Trust;
              Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

         Subject to Section 8.06, all money and non-callable Government
Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other
qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be
held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of
such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any
Paying Agent (including the Issuers acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money
need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

         The Issuers shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or
other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government
Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 or the principal and interest
received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which
by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.

         Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee
shall deliver or pay to the Issuers from time to time upon the request of the
Issuers any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided
in Section 8.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section
8.04(1)), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be
deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

Section 8.06. Repayment to Issuers.

         Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held
by the Issuers, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such
principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Issuers on their request or (if then held by the Issuers) shall be
discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter look
only to the Issuers for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or
such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the
Issuers as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment,
may at the expense of the Issuers cause to be published once, in the New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money
remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be
less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any
unclaimed balance of such money then remaining shall be repaid to the Issuers.

                                     - 80 -
<PAGE>

Section 8.07. Reinstatement.

         If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States
dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or
8.03, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Issuers' obligations under this Indenture and the Notes,
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to
Section 8.02 or 8.03 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted
to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03, as the case may
be; provided, however, that, if the Issuers make any payment of principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of their
obligations, the Issuers shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of
such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying
Agent.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                        AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

Section 9.01. Without Consent of Holders of Notes.

         Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Issuers and the
Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes without the consent
of any Holder of a Note:

         (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

         (2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes;

         (3) to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes;

         (4) to provide for the assumption of either Issuer's obligations to
Holders of Notes in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Issuer pursuant to Article 5;

         (5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or
benefits to the Holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal
rights under this Indenture of any Holder; or

         (6) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or
maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA or otherwise as
necessary to comply with applicable law.

         Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of their
respective boards of directors or the Board of Directors of CCI authorizing the
execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the
Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02, the Trustee shall join with
the Issuers in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized
or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate
agreements and stipulations that may be therein

                                     - 81 -
<PAGE>

contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or
supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under
this Indenture or otherwise.

Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders of Notes.

         Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, this Indenture
(including Sections 4.11 and 4.16) or the Notes may be amended or supplemented
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer
for, Notes) and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07, any existing Default or
compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).
Section 2.08 shall determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for
purposes of this Section 9.02.

         Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of their
respective boards of directors or the Board of Directors of CCI authorizing the
execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing
with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the
Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents
described in Section 10.04, the Trustee shall join with the Issuers in the
execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or
supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in
its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or
supplemental Indenture.

         It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under
this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or
waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

         After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02
becomes effective, the Issuers shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected
thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any
failure of the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not,
however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or
supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07, the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may
waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuers with any provision of
this Indenture or the Notes. However, without the consent of each Holder
affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not
(with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

         (1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to
an amendment, supplement or waiver;

         (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or
alter the payment provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other
than provisions relating to Sections 4.11 and 4.16);

         (3) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on
any Note;

                                     - 82 -
<PAGE>

         (4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a rescission of
acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);

         (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

         (6) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to
waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

         (7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a
payment required by Section 4.11 or 4.16); or

         (8) make any change in this Section 9.02.

Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.

         Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be
set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as
then in effect.

Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents.

         Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent
to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and
every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same
debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not
made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a
Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written
notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes
effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance
with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.

Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes.

         The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment,
supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuers in
exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment,
supplement or waiver.

         Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not
affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.

         The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized
pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Issuers
may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until their respective
Boards of Directors approve it. In executing any amended or supplemental
indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject

                                     - 83 -
<PAGE>

to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the
documents required by Section 10.04, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, in each case from each of the Issuers, stating that the execution of
such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this
Indenture.

the duties imposed by TIA ss. 318(c), the imposed duties shall control.

         Any notice or communication by the Issuers or the Trustee to the others

post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue
principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at a rate that is 2%
per annum in excess of the rate then in effect to the extent lawful; they shall
pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any
applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at the same rate to the
extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months for the actual number of days elapsed. The amount of
interest for each day that the Notes are outstanding (the "Daily Interest
Amount") will be calculated by dividing the interest rate in effect for such day
by 360 and multiplying the result by the principal amount of the Notes. The
amount of interest to be paid on the Notes for each Interest Period will be
calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amounts for each day in the Interest
Period. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards and
all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded
to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards). The interest
rate on the Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
New York law as such rate may be modified by United States law of general
application.

         2. METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Issuers shall pay interest on the Notes
(except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes
at the close of business on the March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 next
preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such
record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in
Section 2.12 of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will
be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or
agency of the Issuers maintained for such purpose within or without the City and
State of New York, or, at the option of the Issuers, payment of interest may be
made by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register
of Holders, and provided that payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds will be required with respect to principal of and interest and premium on
all Global Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided
wire transfer instructions to the Issuers or the Paying Agent. Such payment
shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time
of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

         3. PAYING AGENT, REGISTRAR AND CALCULATION AGENT. Initially, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying Agent,
Registrar and Calculation Agent. The Issuers may change any Paying Agent,
Registrar or Calculation Agent without notice to any Holder. The Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.

                                      A-6
<PAGE>

         4. INDENTURE. The Issuers issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as
of December 15, 2004 (the "Indenture") between the Issuers and the Trustee. The
terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of
the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15
U.S. Code ss. 77aaa-77bbbb). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and
Holders are referred to the Indenture and such Act for a statement of such
terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the express
provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be
controlling.

         5. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION.

                                    (i) Except as set forth in clause (b) of
                  this paragraph 5, the Issuers shall not have the option to
                  redeem the Notes pursuant to this paragraph 5 prior to
                  December 15, 2006. Thereafter, the Issuers shall have the
                  option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the
                  redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal
                  amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest
                  thereon, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if
                  redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on December
                  15 of the years indicated below:

                                    (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of
                  clause (a) of this Paragraph 5, at any time prior to December
                  15, 2006, the Issuers may, on any one or more occasions,
                  redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of
                  the Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional
                  Notes) issued under the Indenture on a pro rata basis (or
                  nearly as pro rata as practicable), at a redemption price of
                  100.00% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium equal
                  to the interest rate per annum applicable to the Notes on the
                  date notice of redemption is given, plus accrued and unpaid
                  interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of
                  one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

                           (1) at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
         amount of Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional
         Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after
         the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company
         and its Subsidiaries); and

                           (2) the redemption must occur within 60 days of the
         date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

         6. MANDATORY REDEMPTION.

                                      A-7
<PAGE>

         Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 7 below, the Issuers shall
not be required to make mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Notes.

         7. REPURCHASE AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

                  (a) If there is a Change of Control, the Issuers shall make an
         offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase all or any part
         (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of each Holder's
         Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
         amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the
         date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 10 days
         following any Change of Control, the Issuers shall mail a notice to
         each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute
         the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of
         Control Payment Date specified in such notice, pursuant to the
         procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

                  (b) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof
         consummates any Asset Sale, when the aggregate amount of Excess
         Proceeds exceeds $25.0 million, the Company shall commence an offer (an
         "Asset Sale Offer") pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Indenture to all
         Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is of equal
         priority with the Notes containing provisions requiring offers to
         purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the
         maximum principal amount of Notes and such other Indebtedness of equal
         priority that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds (which amount
         includes the entire amount of the Net Proceeds). The offer price in any
         Asset Sale Offer will be payable in cash and equal to 100% of principal
         amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
         purchase. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset
         Sale Offer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries thereof may use
         such remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited
         by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such
         other Indebtedness of equal priority tendered into such Asset Sale
         Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select
         the Notes and such other Indebtedness of equal priority to be purchased
         on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the
         amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Holders of Notes that
         are the subject of an offer to purchase will receive an Asset Sale
         Offer from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date and may elect
         to have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of
         Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes.

         8. DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE. The Notes are in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. The
transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged as provided in
the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the
Issuers may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or
permitted by the Indenture. The Issuers need not exchange or register the
transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for
the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. Also, the Issuers
need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days

                                      A-8
<PAGE>

before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the period between a record
date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date.

         9. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder of a Note may be
treated as its owner for all purposes.

         10. AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER. Subject to certain exceptions,
the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any
existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes). Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Issuers and
the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to cure any
ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in
addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to provide for the assumption of
an Issuers' obligations to Holders of Notes in the case of a merger or
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of either
Issuer, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits
to the Holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under
the Indenture of any such Holder, or to comply with the requirements of the SEC
in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA
or otherwise as necessary to comply with applicable law.

         11. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Each of the following is an Event of
Default: (i) default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest
on the Notes, (ii) default in payment when due of the principal of or premium,
if any, on the Notes, (iii) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to comply with Sections 4.16 and 5.01 of the Indenture, (iv)
failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 30 consecutive
days after written notice thereof has been given to the Issuers by the Trustee
or to the Issuers and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% of the
principal amount of the Notes outstanding to comply with any of their other
covenants or agreements in the Indenture, (v) default under any mortgage,
indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or
guarantee now exists or is created after the date of the Indenture, if that
default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay at final stated maturity the
principal amount of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace
period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment
Default"); or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its
express maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness
under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been
so accelerated, aggregates $100 million or more, (vi) failure by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments which are
non-appealable aggregating in excess of $100 million (net of applicable
insurance which has not been denied in writing by the insurer), which judgments
are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days or (vii) certain

                                      A-9
<PAGE>

events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries. In the case of an Event of Default arising from
certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice.
If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to
the Issuers or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare all the
Notes to be due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes
except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may
direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may
withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of
Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of
principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their
interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of
the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences
under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, the Notes. The
Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of
Default, the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement
specifying such Default or Event of Default.

         12. TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH ISSUERS. The Trustee, in its individual or
any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform
services for the Issuers or their Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the
Issuers or their Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

         13. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member or stockholder of either of the Issuers, as such, shall not
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers under the Notes or the
Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

         14. GOVERNING LAW. THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL
GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS NOTE AND THE INDENTURE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT
TO THE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. EACH
OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND THE HOLDERS AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS NOTE.

         15. AUTHENTICATION. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by
the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

         16. ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a
Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

         17. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF RESTRICTED GLOBAL NOTES AND
RESTRICTED DEFINITIVE NOTES. In addition to the rights provided to Holders of
Notes under the Indenture, Holders of Restricted Global Notes and Restricted
Definitive Notes shall have all the rights set forth in any Registration Rights
Agreement.

         18. CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuers have caused
CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may use CUSIP numbers
in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made
as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers placed thereon.

                  The Issuers will furnish to any Holder upon written request
and without charge a copy of the Indenture and/or the Registration Rights
Agreement. Requests may be made to:

         the beneficial interest is being acquired for the Owner's own account
         without transfer, (ii) such Exchange has been effected in compliance

         2. Registration Under the Securities Act.

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Issuers
agree to file under the Securities Act, as soon as practicable, but no later
than 90 days after the Closing Date, a registration statement relating to an
offer to exchange (such registration statement, the "Exchange Offer Registration
Statement", and such offer, the "Exchange Offer") any and all of the Notes for a
like aggregate principal amount of notes issued by the Issuers, which notes are
substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes (and are entitled
to the benefits of the Indenture which has been qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions
for the additional interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such notes
hereinafter called "Exchange Notes"). The Issuers agree to use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become or be
declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable, but no later
than 210 days after the Closing Date. The Exchange Offer will be registered
under the Securities Act on the appropriate form and will comply with the
Exchange Act. The Issuers further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
complete the Exchange Offer promptly, but no later than 30 business days or
longer, if required by the federal securities laws, after such registration
statement has become effective, hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 20
business days (calculated in accordance with the Exchange Act) and exchange
Exchange Notes for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered
and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The
Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been completed only if the Exchange Notes
received by holders, other than Restricted Holders, in the Exchange Offer in
exchange for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such
holder without restriction under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a
substantial majority of the States of the United States of America. The Exchange
Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the earlier to occur of (i)
the Issuers having exchanged the Exchange Notes for all outstanding Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer and (ii) the Issuers having exchanged,
pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Notes for all Registrable Securities
that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the
Exchange Offer. The Issuers agree (x) to include in the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of
Exchange Notes that is a broker-dealer and (y) to keep such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement effective for a period (the "Resale Period") beginning
when Exchange Notes are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the
earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange Offer has been
completed or such time as such broker-dealers no longer own any Registrable
Securities. With respect to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, such
holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution
set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e) hereof.

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (b) If (i) on or prior to the time the Exchange Offer is
completed existing law or Commission policy or interpretations are changed such
that the Exchange Notes received by holders, other than Restricted Holders, in
the Exchange Offer in exchange for Registrable Securities are not or would not
be, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the
Securities Act, (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been
declared effective under the Securities Act within 210 days following the
Closing Date, or completed within 30 business days after the effectiveness of
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, or longer, if required by the federal
securities laws, (iii) any Purchaser so requests with respect to Registrable
Securities that are not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Notes in the
Exchange Offer and that are held by it following the consummation of the
Exchange Offer, or (iv) the Exchange Offer is not available to any holder (other
than a Purchaser), the Issuers shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause
(iii) or (iv), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by
Section 2(a), file a "shelf" registration statement in accordance with the
remainder of this Section 2(b) below, under the Securities Act. The Issuers
shall, on or prior to 30 business days after the time such obligation to file
arises, file a "shelf" registration statement providing for the registration of,
and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all the
Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be
adopted by the Commission (such filing, the "Shelf Registration" and such
registration statement, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The Issuers agree
to use their reasonable best efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration
Statement to become or be declared effective by the Commission no later than 90
days after such obligation to file arises and to keep such Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the
second anniversary of the Effective Time or (ii) such time as there are no
longer any Registrable Securities outstanding; provided, however, that no holder
(other than a Purchaser) shall be entitled to be named as a selling
securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus
forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder
is an Electing Holder, and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf
Registration Statement, promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable
Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably
necessary to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for
resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action
necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf
Registration Statement, provided, however, that nothing in this clause (y) shall
relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed
Notice and Questionnaire to the Issuers in accordance with Section 3(e)(iii)
hereof. The Issuers further agree to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf
Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Issuers for such
Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act for shelf registration,
and the Issuers agree to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such
supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing
with the Commission.

                  (c) In the event that (i) the Issuers have not filed the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement on or
before the date on which such registration statement is required to be filed
pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (ii) such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective
or been declared effective by the Commission on or before the date on which such
registration statement is required to become or be declared effective pursuant
to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (iii) the Exchange Offer has not been
completed within 30 business days after the initial effective date of the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement relating to the Exchange Offer (if the
Exchange Offer is then required to be made) or (iv) any Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a)
or 2(b) hereof is filed and becomes or is declared effective but shall
thereafter either be withdrawn by the Issuers or shall become subject to an
effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities

                                       5
<PAGE>

Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as
specifically permitted herein) without being succeeded immediately by an
additional registration statement filed and declared effective (each such event
referred to in clauses (i) through (iv), a "Registration Default" and each
period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a
"Registration Default Period"), then, as liquidated damages for such
Registration Default, subject to the provisions of Section 9(b), special
interest ("Special Interest"), in addition to the Base Interest, shall accrue on
the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Transfer Restricted Notes (as
defined below) affected by such Registration Default at a per annum rate of
0.25% for the first 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum
rate of 0.50% for the second 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a
per annum rate of 0.75% for the third 90 days of the Registration Default Period
and at a per annum rate of 1.00% thereafter for the remaining portion of the
Registration Default Period. All accrued Special Interest shall be paid in cash
by the Issuers on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture).
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the case of an event referred to in clause (ii) above, a "Registration Default"
shall be deemed not to have occurred so long as the Issuers have used and are
continuing to use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, to
become or be declared effective. For purposes of this Agreement, "Transfer
Restricted Notes" shall mean, with respect to any Registration Default, any
Notes or Exchange Notes which have not ceased being Registrable Securities
pursuant to the definition thereof in Section 1 of this Agreement.

                  (d) If any Purchaser determines that it is not eligible to
participate in the Exchange Offer with respect to the exchange of Registrable
Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, at the request of
such Purchaser, then, subject to any prohibitions or restrictions imposed by any
applicable law or regulations, the Issuers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to issue and deliver to such Purchaser, in exchange for such
Registrable Securities, a like principal amount of Exchange Notes. Such issuance
shall not be deemed to be part of the Exchange Offer. The Issuers shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the CUSIP Service Bureau to issue
the same CUSIP number for Exchange Notes described in this Section 2(d) as for
Exchange Notes issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Any such Exchange Notes
shall, at the time of issuance, and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 1 hereof, constitute Registrable Securities for purposes of this
Agreement (other than Section 2(a) hereof).

                  (e) The Issuers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take all actions necessary or advisable to be taken by them to ensure that the
transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated in Section 2(a)
or 2(b) hereof.

                  (f) Any reference herein to a registration statement as of any
time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be
incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to
any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be
deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated,
therein by reference as of such time.

         3. Registration Procedures.

         If the Issuers file a registration statement pursuant to Section 2(a)
or Section 2(b), the following provisions shall apply:

                  (a) At or before the Effective Time of the Exchange Offer or
the Shelf Registration, as the case may be, the Issuers shall cause the
Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (b) In the event that such qualification would require the
appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Issuers shall appoint a
new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture.

                  (c) In connection with the Issuers' obligations with respect
to the registration of Exchange Notes as contemplated by Section 2(a) (the
"Exchange Offer Registration"); if applicable, the Issuers shall, as soon as
practicable (or as otherwise specified):

                           (i) prepare and file with the Commission, as soon as
                  practicable but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
                  an Exchange Offer Registration Statement on any form which may
                  be utilized by the Issuers and which shall permit the Exchange
                  Offer and resales of Exchange Notes by broker-dealers during
                  the Resale Period to be effected as contemplated by Section
                  2(a), and use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become or be declared
                  effective as soon as practicable thereafter, but no later than
                  210 days after the Closing Date;

                           (ii) as soon as practicable prepare and file with the
                  Commission such amendments and supplements to such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement and the prospectus included
                  therein as may be necessary to effect and maintain the
                  effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement
                  for the periods and purposes contemplated in Section 2(a)
                  hereof and as may be required by the applicable rules and
                  regulations of the Commission and the instructions applicable
                  to the form of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and
                  promptly provide each broker-dealer holding Exchange Notes
                  with such number of copies of the prospectus included therein
                  (as then amended or supplemented), in conformity in all
                  material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
                  and the Trust Indenture Act, as such broker-dealer reasonably
                  may request prior to the expiration of the Resale Period, for
                  use in connection with resales of Exchange Notes;

                           (iii) promptly notify the Purchasers, and each
                  broker-dealer that has requested or received copies of the
                  prospectus included in such registration statement, and
                  confirm such advice in writing, (A) when such Exchange Offer
                  Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or
                  any prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective
                  amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment,
                  when the same has become effective, (B) of any comments by the
                  Commission and by the blue sky or securities commissioner or
                  regulator of any state with respect thereto, or any request by
                  the Commission for amendments or supplements to such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional
                  information, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
                  order suspending the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer
                  Registration Statement or the initiation or, to the knowledge
                  of the Issuers, threatening of any proceedings for that
                  purpose, (D) if at any time the representations and warranties
                  of the Issuers contemplated by Section 5 hereof cease to be
                  true and correct in all material respects, (E) of the receipt
                  by the Issuers of any notification with respect to the
                  suspension of the qualification of the Exchange Notes for sale
                  in any jurisdiction or the initiation or, to the knowledge of

                  Act, or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
                  omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
                  or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
                  light of the circumstances then existing;

                           (iv) in the event that the Issuers would be required,
                  pursuant to Section 3(c)(iii)(F) above, to notify the
                  Purchasers and any broker-dealers holding Exchange Notes, the
                  Issuers shall prepare and furnish to each such holder a
                  reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or
                  amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of such
                  Exchange Notes during the Resale Period, such prospectus
                  conforms in all material respects to the applicable
                  requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act
                  and shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact

                  or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
                  light of the circumstances then existing;

                           (v) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
                  withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such
                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement or any post-effective

                  permit the continuance of offers, sales and dealings therein
                  in such jurisdictions until the expiration of the Resale

                  in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that neither of the
                  Issuers shall be required for any such purpose to (1) qualify
                  as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as the

                  counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the
                  meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; provided,
                  however, that each such party shall be required to maintain in
                  confidence and not to disclose to any other person any
                  information or records reasonably designated by the Issuers as
                  being confidential, until such time as (A) such information

                  as a result of a breach of this or any other obligation of
                  confidentiality to the Issuers), or (B) such person shall be

                  requirement), or (C) such information is required to be set
                  forth in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the
                  prospectus included therein or in an amendment to such
                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement or an amendment or
                  supplement to such prospectus in order that such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement, prospectus, amendment or
                  supplement, as the case may be, complies with applicable
                  requirements of the federal securities laws and the rules and
                  regulations of the Commission and does not contain an untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state therein a
                  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
                  make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
                  circumstances then existing, provided further, however, that

                  any such person (and each employee, representative, or other
                  agent of such person) may disclose to any and all persons,
                  without limitation, the U.S. tax treatment and any facts that
                  may be relevant to the tax structure of the matters covered by
                  and relating to this Agreement (including opinions or other
                  tax analysis that are provided to such party relating to such
                  tax treatment and tax structure); provided, however, that no
                  person (and no employee, representative, or other agent of any
                  person) shall disclose any other information that is not
                  relevant to understanding the tax treatment and tax structure
                  of the matters covered by and relating to this Agreement
                  (including the identity of any party and any information that
                  could lead another to determine the identity of any party), or
                  any other information to the extent that such non-disclosure
                  is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable
                  securities law.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange
Offer, the Issuers shall:

                           (i) accept for exchange all Registrable Securities
                  tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange
                  Offer;

                           (ii) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all
                  Notes so accepted for exchange; and

                           (iii) cause the Trustee promptly to authenticate and
                  deliver to each holder a principal amount of Exchange Notes
                  equal to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities of
                  such Holder so accepted for exchange.

                  (e) In connection with the Issuers' obligations with respect
to the Shelf Registration, if applicable, the Issuers shall, as soon as
practicable (or as otherwise specified):

                  time periods specified in Section 2(b), a Shelf Registration
                  Statement on any form which may be utilized by the Issuers and
                  which shall register all the Registrable Securities for resale
                  by the holders thereof in accordance with such method or
                  methods of disposition as may be specified by such of the
                  holders as, from time to time, may be Electing Holders and use
                  their reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
                  Statement to become or be declared effective within the time
                  periods specified in Section 2(b);

                           (ii) not less than 30 calendar days prior to the
                  Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement, mail the
                  Notice and Questionnaire to the holders of Registrable
                  Securities; no holder shall be entitled to be named as a
                  selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement as
                  of the Effective Time, and no holder shall be entitled to use
                  the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of
                  Registrable Securities at any time, unless such holder has
                  returned a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to
                  the Issuers by the deadline for response set forth therein;
                  provided, however, holders of Registrable Securities shall
                  have at least 28 calendar days from the date on which the
                  Notice and Questionnaire is first mailed to such holders to

                  Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder,
                  promptly send a Notice and Questionnaire to such holder;
                  provided that the Issuers shall not be required to take any
                  action to name such holder as a selling securityholder in the
                  Shelf Registration Statement or to enable such holder to use
                  the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of
                  Registrable Securities until such holder has returned a
                  completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Issuers;

                  supplement or amendment simultaneously with or prior to its
                  being used or filed with the Commission;

                  the consent or approval of each governmental agency or

                  the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in
                  Section 6 hereof (or to such other customary extent as may be
                  requested by such underwriter), and (C) providing such
                  information to such broker-dealer as may be required in order
                  for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the
                  Conduct Rules; and

                           (xx) comply with all applicable rules and regulations
                  of the Commission, and make generally available to its
                  securityholders as soon as practicable but in any event not
                  later than eighteen months after the effective date of such
                  Shelf Registration Statement, an earning statement of the
                  Company and its subsidiaries complying with Section 11(a) of
                  the Securities Act (including, at the option of the Company,
                  Rule 158 thereunder).

                  (f) In the event that the Issuers would be required, pursuant
to Section 3(e)(viii)(F) hereof, to notify the Electing Holders, the placement
or sales agent, if any, therefor and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof,
the Issuers shall prepare and furnish to each of the Electing Holders, to each
placement or sales agent, if any, and to each such underwriter, if any, a
reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as
thereafter delivered to purchasers of Registrable Securities, such prospectus
conforms in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act, and shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances then existing. Each Electing Holder agrees that upon
receipt of any notice from the Issuers pursuant to Section 3(e)(viii)(F) hereof,
such Electing Holder shall forthwith discontinue the disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement applicable to such
Registrable Securities until such Electing Holder shall have received copies of
such amended or supplemented prospectus, and if so directed by the Issuers, such
Electing Holder shall deliver to the Issuers (at the Issuers' expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Electing Holder's
possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of
receipt of such notice.

                  (g) In the event of a Shelf Registration, in addition to the
information required to be provided by each Electing Holder in its Notice and
Questionnaire, the Issuers may require such Electing Holder to furnish to the
Issuers such additional information regarding such Electing Holder and such
Electing Holder's intended method of distribution of Registrable Securities as
may be required in order to comply with the Securities Act. Each such Electing
Holder agrees to notify the Issuers as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy
or change in information previously furnished by such Electing Holder to the
Issuers or of the occurrence of any event in either case as a result of which
any prospectus relating to such Shelf Registration contains or would contain an
untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such
Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities
or omits to state any material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such
Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities
required to be stated therein or necessary to

                                       17
<PAGE>

make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
existing, and promptly to furnish to the Issuers any additional information
required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required
so that such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to such Electing Holder
or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances then existing.

         4. Registration Expenses.

         The Issuers agree, subject to the last sentence of this Section 4, to

3(e)(xii) hereof and determination of their eligibility for investment under the

sale or delivery of Notes and the preparation of documents referred in clause
(c) above, (e) fees and expenses of the Trustee under the Indenture, any agent

without limitation, all salaries and expenses of the Issuers' officers and
employees performing legal or accounting duties), (g) fees, disbursements and

in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities held by Electing
Holders (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuers), (j) any
fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Notes, and (k)
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any other persons, including,
without limitation, special experts, retained by the Issuers in connection with
such registration (collectively, the "Registration Expenses"). To the extent
that any Registration Expenses are incurred, assumed or paid by any holder of
Registrable Securities or any placement or sales agent therefor or underwriter
thereof, the Issuers shall reimburse such person for the full amount of the
Registration Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid promptly after receipt of a
request therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of the Registrable
Securities being registered shall pay all agency fees and commissions and
underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of such
Registrable Securities

                                       18
<PAGE>

and the fees and disbursements of any counsel or other advisors or experts
retained by such holders (severally or jointly), other than the counsel and
experts specifically referred to above.

         5. Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

         Except with respect to clauses (a) and (b) below, the Issuers represent
and warrant to, and agree with, each Purchaser and each of the holders from time
to time of Registrable Securities the information set forth in this Section 5.

         With respect to clauses (a) and (b) below, the Issuers covenant that:

                  (a) Each registration statement covering Registrable
Securities and each prospectus (including, without limitation, any preliminary
or summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(e)
or Section 3(c) hereof and any further amendments or supplements to any such
registration statement or prospectus, when it becomes effective or is filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, and, in the case of an underwritten offering
of Registrable Securities, at the time of the closing under the underwriting
agreement relating thereto, will conform in all material respects to the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and at all times subsequent to the Effective Time when a prospectus
would be required to be delivered under the Securities Act, other than from (i)
such time as a notice has been given to holders of Registrable Securities
pursuant to Section 3(e)(viii)(F) or Section 3(c)(iii)(F) hereof until (ii) such
time as the Issuers furnishes an amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to
Section 3(f) or Section 3(c)(iv) hereof, each such registration statement, and
each prospectus (including, without limitation, any preliminary or summary
prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(e) or Section
3(c) hereof, as then amended or supplemented, will conform in all material
respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act
and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing;
provided, however, that this covenant shall not apply to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Issuers by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use
therein.

                  (b) Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus
referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are
or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed
in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this covenant shall
not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Issuers by a holder of Registrable
Securities expressly for use therein.

                  (c) The compliance by the Issuers with all the provisions of
this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a material
breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease, license, franchise
agreement, permit or other material agreement or instrument to which either of
the Issuers or any of Charter Communications, Inc. ("CCI"), Charter
Communications Holding

                                       19
<PAGE>

Company, LLC ("CCH LLC"), Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), CCH
I, LLC ("CCH I") and CCH II, LLC (collectively with CCI, CCH LLC, Holdings and
CCH I, the "Parent Companies") or the Issuers' subsidiaries is a party or by
which either of the Issuers or any of their Parent Companies or the Issuers'
subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Issuers
or any of their Parent Companies or the Issuers' subsidiaries is subject, nor
will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of
formation or limited liability company agreement of the Company or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of CCO Holdings Capital or any statute or
any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body,
including without limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the
Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, the Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, as amended, and the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (collectively, the "Cable Acts") or any order,
rule or regulation of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), having
jurisdiction over the Issuers or any of their Parent Companies or the Issuers'
subsidiaries or any of their properties, except for any such violation which
would not materially impair the Issuers' ability to comply herewith; and no
consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or
with any such court or governmental agency or body is required, including,
without limitation, under the Cable Acts or any order, rule or regulation of the
FCC, for the consummation by the Issuers of the transactions contemplated by
this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, except the registration under
the Securities Act of the Notes, qualification of the Indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
qualifications as may be required under State Notes or blue sky laws in
connection with the offering and distribution of the Notes.

                  (d) This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuers.

         6. Indemnification.

                  (a) The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and
hold harmless each holder of Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes, as the
case may be, covered by any Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf
Registration Statement (including each Purchaser and, with respect to any
prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 3(c)(ii) or (iv) hereof, each
holder (which may include any Purchaser) that is a broker-dealer and elects to
exchange for Exchange Notes any Registrable Securities that it acquired for its
own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities
(but not directly from the Issuers or any affiliate of the Issuers) for Exchange
Notes) (each an "Exchanging Dealer"), the affiliates, directors, officers,
employees and agents of each such holder and each person who controls any such
holder within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common
law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in
any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary prospectus or the prospectus
included in any registration statement, or in any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse
each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however,

                                       20
<PAGE>

that the Issuers will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made
therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Issuers by or on behalf of any such holder specifically for inclusion
therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the
Issuers may otherwise have.

                  The Issuers, jointly and severally, also agree to indemnify or
contribute as provided in Section 6(d) to Losses of any underwriter of
Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes, as the case may be, registered under a
Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees or agents and
each person who controls such underwriter within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, on substantially the same basis as that of
the indemnification of the Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this
Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any holder, enter into an underwriting
agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 3(e)(xvi) hereof.

                  (b) Each holder of Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes
covered by an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement (including each Purchaser and, with respect to any prospectus delivery
as contemplated in Section 3(c)(ii or iv) or Section 3(f) hereof, each
Exchanging Dealer) severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers
and each of their affiliates, directors, employees, members, managers and agents
and each Person who controls the Issuers within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Issuers to each such holder, but only with reference to
written information relating to such holder furnished to the Issuers by or on
behalf of such holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in
the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
liability which any such holder may otherwise have.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i)
will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and
to the extent such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the
indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any
event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified
party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b)
above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to
the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to
such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the
indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, except as
provided in the next sentence, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
rights in the prior sentence, the indemnified party shall have the right to
employ its own counsel (and one local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the
use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified
party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or
potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall
have reasonably concluded that there may be

                                       21
<PAGE>

legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii)
the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party
shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense
of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, in connection with any
one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general circumstances or allegations, be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in
addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. An indemnifying
party shall not be liable under this Section 6 to any indemnified party
regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such
claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to
by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party agrees
to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including, without limitation, legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to
which such indemnifying party may be subject in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party
on the one hand and by the indemnified party on the other from the offering of
the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed
to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits
but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Benefits received by the Issuers shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of (x)
the total net proceeds from the initial placement of the Notes (before deducting
expenses) reflected in the Purchase Agreement and (y) the total amount of
Special Interest which the Issuers were not required to pay as a result of
registering the securities covered by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
or Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Benefits received
by the Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts
and commissions as reflected in the Purchase Agreement, and benefits received by
any other holders shall be deemed to be equal to the proceeds received from the
sale of the Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes, as applicable. Benefits
received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total
underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth in the prospectus forming a
part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement which resulted in such Losses. The relative fault shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the
one hand or the Indemnified party on the other and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata
allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses,

                                       22
<PAGE>

claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection (d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder
from the sale of Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and
commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such
holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price of the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the
public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. The holders' and any underwriters' obligations in
this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the principal
amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be,
by them, and not joint. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this
Section 6, each person who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the
meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director,
officer, employee and agent of a holder, agent or underwriter shall have the
same rights to contribution as such holder, agent or underwriter, and each
person who controls the Issuers within the meaning of either the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Issuers shall have the
same rights to contribution as the Issuers, subject in each case to the
applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

                  (e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force
and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any holder
or the Issuers or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred
to in this Section hereof, and will survive the sale by a holder of securities
covered by an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement.

         7. Underwritten Offerings.

                  (a) Selection of Underwriters. If any of the Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an
underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be
designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering,
provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are
reasonably acceptable to the Issuers.

                  (b) Participation by Holders. Each holder of Registrable
Securities hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may
participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees
to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve
such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

         8. Rule 144.

                                       23
<PAGE>

         Each of the Issuers covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities
that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, it
shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act (including, without limitation, the reports under Section
13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144
adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act), and shall take such further
action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations
of the exemption provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any similar
or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon the
request of any holder of Registrable Securities in connection with that holder's
sale pursuant to Rule 144, the Issuers shall deliver to such holder a written
statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

         9. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Issuers represent,
warrant, covenant and agree that they have not granted, and shall not grant,
registration rights with respect to Registrable Securities or any other Notes
which would be inconsistent with the terms contained in this Exchange and
Registration Rights Agreement.

                  (b) Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge that
there would be no adequate remedy at law if the Issuers fail to perform any of
their obligations hereunder and that the Purchasers and the holders from time to
time of the Registrable Securities may be irreparably harmed by any such
failure, and accordingly agree that the Purchasers and such holders, in addition
to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, shall be
entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of the Issuers under
this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, in any court of
the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction.

                  (c) Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers
and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been duly given (i) when delivered by hand, if delivered personally or by
courier, (ii) when sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt),
provided that a copy is mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested or (iii) three days after being deposited in the mail (registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested) as follows: If to the
Issuers, c/o CCO Holdings, LLC, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St. Louis, Missouri,
63131, Attention: Secretary, and if to a holder, to the address of such holder
set forth in the security register or other records of the Issuers, or to such
other address as the Issuers or any such holder may have furnished to the other
in writing in accordance herewith, with a copy in like manner c/o Credit Suisse
First Boston LLC Attn: [_____________], Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New
York 10010 (fax: (212) [________]). Notices of change of address shall be
effective only upon receipt.

                  (d) Parties in Interest. All the terms and provisions of this
Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and the holders
from time to time of the Registrable Securities and the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto and such holders. In the event that any person

                          CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS CLOSES
                $550 MILLION SENIOR FLOATING RATE NOTES OFFERING

         ST. LOUIS -- Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) (Nasdaq: CHTR)
today announced that its indirect subsidiaries, CCO Holdings, LLC (CCO Holdings)
and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., have closed on the issuance of $550 million
Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the Notes). The Notes have an annual
interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.125%, payable quarterly. The intent to offer $500
million principal amount of Notes was initially announced in a press release on
December 1, 2004. The increase to $550 million was announced on December 2,
2004, after the Notes were priced.

         Charter plans to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay
down debt and for general corporate purposes.

         The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on
Regulation S. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws.

         This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in any
state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
