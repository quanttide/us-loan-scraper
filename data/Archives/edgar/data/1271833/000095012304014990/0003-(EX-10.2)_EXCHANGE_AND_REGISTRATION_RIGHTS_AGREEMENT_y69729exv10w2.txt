         2. Registration Under the Securities Act.

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Issuers
agree to file under the Securities Act, as soon as practicable, but no later
than 90 days after the Closing Date, a registration statement relating to an
offer to exchange (such registration statement, the "Exchange Offer Registration
Statement", and such offer, the "Exchange Offer") any and all of the Notes for a
like aggregate principal amount of notes issued by the Issuers, which notes are
substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes (and are entitled
to the benefits of the Indenture which has been qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions
for the additional interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such notes
hereinafter called "Exchange Notes"). The Issuers agree to use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become or be
declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as practicable, but no later
than 210 days after the Closing Date. The Exchange Offer will be registered
under the Securities Act on the appropriate form and will comply with the
Exchange Act. The Issuers further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
complete the Exchange Offer promptly, but no later than 30 business days or
longer, if required by the federal securities laws, after such registration
statement has become effective, hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 20
business days (calculated in accordance with the Exchange Act) and exchange
Exchange Notes for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered
and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The
Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been completed only if the Exchange Notes
received by holders, other than Restricted Holders, in the Exchange Offer in
exchange for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such
holder without restriction under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a
substantial majority of the States of the United States of America. The Exchange
Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the earlier to occur of (i)
the Issuers having exchanged the Exchange Notes for all outstanding Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer and (ii) the Issuers having exchanged,
pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Notes for all Registrable Securities
that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the
Exchange Offer. The Issuers agree (x) to include in the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of
Exchange Notes that is a broker-dealer and (y) to keep such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement effective for a period (the "Resale Period") beginning
when Exchange Notes are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the
earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange Offer has been
completed or such time as such broker-dealers no longer own any Registrable
Securities. With respect to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, such
holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution
set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e) hereof.

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (b) If (i) on or prior to the time the Exchange Offer is
completed existing law or Commission policy or interpretations are changed such
that the Exchange Notes received by holders, other than Restricted Holders, in
the Exchange Offer in exchange for Registrable Securities are not or would not
be, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the
Securities Act, (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been
declared effective under the Securities Act within 210 days following the
Closing Date, or completed within 30 business days after the effectiveness of
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, or longer, if required by the federal
securities laws, (iii) any Purchaser so requests with respect to Registrable
Securities that are not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Notes in the
Exchange Offer and that are held by it following the consummation of the
Exchange Offer, or (iv) the Exchange Offer is not available to any holder (other
than a Purchaser), the Issuers shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause
(iii) or (iv), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by
Section 2(a), file a "shelf" registration statement in accordance with the
remainder of this Section 2(b) below, under the Securities Act. The Issuers
shall, on or prior to 30 business days after the time such obligation to file
arises, file a "shelf" registration statement providing for the registration of,
and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all the
Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be
adopted by the Commission (such filing, the "Shelf Registration" and such
registration statement, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The Issuers agree
to use their reasonable best efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration
Statement to become or be declared effective by the Commission no later than 90
days after such obligation to file arises and to keep such Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the
second anniversary of the Effective Time or (ii) such time as there are no
longer any Registrable Securities outstanding; provided, however, that no holder
(other than a Purchaser) shall be entitled to be named as a selling
securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus
forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder
is an Electing Holder, and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf
Registration Statement, promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable
Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably
necessary to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for
resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action
necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf
Registration Statement, provided, however, that nothing in this clause (y) shall
relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed
Notice and Questionnaire to the Issuers in accordance with Section 3(e)(iii)
hereof. The Issuers further agree to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf
Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Issuers for such
Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act for shelf registration,
and the Issuers agree to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such
supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing
with the Commission.

                  (c) In the event that (i) the Issuers have not filed the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement on or
before the date on which such registration statement is required to be filed
pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (ii) such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective
or been declared effective by the Commission on or before the date on which such
registration statement is required to become or be declared effective pursuant
to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (iii) the Exchange Offer has not been
completed within 30 business days after the initial effective date of the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement relating to the Exchange Offer (if the
Exchange Offer is then required to be made) or (iv) any Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a)
or 2(b) hereof is filed and becomes or is declared effective but shall
thereafter either be withdrawn by the Issuers or shall become subject to an
effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities

                                       5
<PAGE>

Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as
specifically permitted herein) without being succeeded immediately by an
additional registration statement filed and declared effective (each such event
referred to in clauses (i) through (iv), a "Registration Default" and each
period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a
"Registration Default Period"), then, as liquidated damages for such
Registration Default, subject to the provisions of Section 9(b), special
interest ("Special Interest"), in addition to the Base Interest, shall accrue on
the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Transfer Restricted Notes (as
defined below) affected by such Registration Default at a per annum rate of
0.25% for the first 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum
rate of 0.50% for the second 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a
per annum rate of 0.75% for the third 90 days of the Registration Default Period
and at a per annum rate of 1.00% thereafter for the remaining portion of the
Registration Default Period. All accrued Special Interest shall be paid in cash
by the Issuers on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture).
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the case of an event referred to in clause (ii) above, a "Registration Default"
shall be deemed not to have occurred so long as the Issuers have used and are
continuing to use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, to
become or be declared effective. For purposes of this Agreement, "Transfer
Restricted Notes" shall mean, with respect to any Registration Default, any
Notes or Exchange Notes which have not ceased being Registrable Securities
pursuant to the definition thereof in Section 1 of this Agreement.

                  (d) If any Purchaser determines that it is not eligible to
participate in the Exchange Offer with respect to the exchange of Registrable
Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, at the request of
such Purchaser, then, subject to any prohibitions or restrictions imposed by any
applicable law or regulations, the Issuers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to issue and deliver to such Purchaser, in exchange for such
Registrable Securities, a like principal amount of Exchange Notes. Such issuance
shall not be deemed to be part of the Exchange Offer. The Issuers shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the CUSIP Service Bureau to issue
the same CUSIP number for Exchange Notes described in this Section 2(d) as for
Exchange Notes issued pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Any such Exchange Notes
shall, at the time of issuance, and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 1 hereof, constitute Registrable Securities for purposes of this
Agreement (other than Section 2(a) hereof).

                  (e) The Issuers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take all actions necessary or advisable to be taken by them to ensure that the
transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated in Section 2(a)
or 2(b) hereof.

                  (f) Any reference herein to a registration statement as of any
time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be
incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to
any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be
deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated,
therein by reference as of such time.

         3. Registration Procedures.

         If the Issuers file a registration statement pursuant to Section 2(a)
or Section 2(b), the following provisions shall apply:

                  (a) At or before the Effective Time of the Exchange Offer or
the Shelf Registration, as the case may be, the Issuers shall cause the
Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

                                       6
<PAGE>

                  (b) In the event that such qualification would require the
appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Issuers shall appoint a
new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture.

                  (c) In connection with the Issuers' obligations with respect
to the registration of Exchange Notes as contemplated by Section 2(a) (the
"Exchange Offer Registration"); if applicable, the Issuers shall, as soon as
practicable (or as otherwise specified):

                           (i) prepare and file with the Commission, as soon as
                  practicable but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
                  an Exchange Offer Registration Statement on any form which may
                  be utilized by the Issuers and which shall permit the Exchange
                  Offer and resales of Exchange Notes by broker-dealers during
                  the Resale Period to be effected as contemplated by Section
                  2(a), and use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become or be declared
                  effective as soon as practicable thereafter, but no later than
                  210 days after the Closing Date;

                           (ii) as soon as practicable prepare and file with the
                  Commission such amendments and supplements to such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement and the prospectus included
                  therein as may be necessary to effect and maintain the
                  effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement
                  for the periods and purposes contemplated in Section 2(a)
                  hereof and as may be required by the applicable rules and
                  regulations of the Commission and the instructions applicable
                  to the form of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and
                  promptly provide each broker-dealer holding Exchange Notes
                  with such number of copies of the prospectus included therein
                  (as then amended or supplemented), in conformity in all
                  material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
                  and the Trust Indenture Act, as such broker-dealer reasonably
                  may request prior to the expiration of the Resale Period, for
                  use in connection with resales of Exchange Notes;

                           (iii) promptly notify the Purchasers, and each
                  broker-dealer that has requested or received copies of the
                  prospectus included in such registration statement, and
                  confirm such advice in writing, (A) when such Exchange Offer
                  Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or
                  any prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective
                  amendment has been filed, and, with respect to such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment,
                  when the same has become effective, (B) of any comments by the
                  Commission and by the blue sky or securities commissioner or
                  regulator of any state with respect thereto, or any request by
                  the Commission for amendments or supplements to such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional
                  information, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
                  order suspending the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer
                  Registration Statement or the initiation or, to the knowledge
                  of the Issuers, threatening of any proceedings for that
                  purpose, (D) if at any time the representations and warranties
                  of the Issuers contemplated by Section 5 hereof cease to be
                  true and correct in all material respects, (E) of the receipt
                  by the Issuers of any notification with respect to the
                  suspension of the qualification of the Exchange Notes for sale
                  in any jurisdiction or the initiation or, to the knowledge of

<PAGE>

                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement, prospectus, prospectus
                  amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment does not
                  conform in all material respects to the applicable
                  requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture
                  Act, or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
                  omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
                  or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
                  light of the circumstances then existing;

                           (iv) in the event that the Issuers would be required,
                  pursuant to Section 3(c)(iii)(F) above, to notify the
                  Purchasers and any broker-dealers holding Exchange Notes, the
                  Issuers shall prepare and furnish to each such holder a
                  reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or
                  amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of such
                  Exchange Notes during the Resale Period, such prospectus

                  and shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
                  or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
                  or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
                  light of the circumstances then existing;

                           (v) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
                  withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such

                  holding Exchange Notes to consummate the disposition thereof

                  as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as the
                  case may be, in any jurisdiction wherein it would not

                  holders of its ownership interests;

                           (vii) use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
                  consent or approval of each governmental agency or authority,
                  whether federal, state or local, which may be required to
                  effect the Exchange Offer Registration, the Exchange Offer and
                  the offering and sale of Exchange Notes by broker-dealers

                  commercially reasonable efforts to reflect in each such
                  document, when so filed with the Commission, such comments as

                  reasonably necessary, in the judgment of the Purchasers'
                  counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the
                  meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; provided,
                  however, that each such party shall be required to maintain in
                  confidence and not to disclose to any other person any
                  information or records reasonably designated by the Issuers as
                  being confidential, until such time as (A) such information

                  inclusion in such registration statement or otherwise, except
                  as a result of a breach of this or any other obligation of
                  confidentiality to the Issuers), or (B) such person shall be

                  subpoena or order of any court or other governmental agency or
                  body having jurisdiction over the matter (subject to the

                  have given the Issuers prompt prior written notice of such
                  requirement), or (C) such information is required to be set
                  forth in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the
                  prospectus included therein or in an amendment to such
                  Exchange Offer Registration Statement or an amendment or
                  supplement to such prospectus in order that such Exchange
                  Offer Registration Statement, prospectus, amendment or
                  supplement, as the case may be, complies with applicable
                  requirements of the federal securities laws and the rules and
                  regulations of the Commission and does not contain an untrue
                  statement of a material fact or omit to state therein a
                  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
                  make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
                  circumstances then existing, provided further, however, that
                  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (xvi),
                  any such person (and each employee, representative, or other
                  agent of such person) may disclose to any and all persons,
                  without limitation, the U.S. tax treatment and any facts that
                  may be relevant to the tax structure of the matters covered by
                  and relating to this Agreement (including opinions or other
                  tax analysis that are provided to such party relating to such
                  tax treatment and tax structure); provided, however, that no
                  person (and no employee, representative, or other agent of any
                  person) shall disclose any other information that is not
                  relevant to understanding the tax treatment and tax structure
                  of the matters covered by and relating to this Agreement
                  (including the identity of any party and any information that
                  could lead another to determine the identity of any party), or
                  any other information to the extent that such non-disclosure
                  is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable
                  securities law.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange
Offer, the Issuers shall:

                           (i) accept for exchange all Registrable Securities
                  tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange
                  Offer;

                           (ii) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all
                  Notes so accepted for exchange; and

                                       10

                           (iii) cause the Trustee promptly to authenticate and
                  deliver to each holder a principal amount of Exchange Notes
                  equal to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities of
                  such Holder so accepted for exchange.

                  (e) In connection with the Issuers' obligations with respect
to the Shelf Registration, if applicable, the Issuers shall, as soon as
practicable (or as otherwise specified):

                           (i) prepare and file with the Commission within the
                  time periods specified in Section 2(b), a Shelf Registration
                  Statement on any form which may be utilized by the Issuers and
                  which shall register all the Registrable Securities for resale
                  by the holders thereof in accordance with such method or
                  methods of disposition as may be specified by such of the
                  holders as, from time to time, may be Electing Holders and use
                  their reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
                  Statement to become or be declared effective within the time
                  periods specified in Section 2(b);

                           (ii) not less than 30 calendar days prior to the
                  Effective Time of the Shelf Registration Statement, mail the
                  Notice and Questionnaire to the holders of Registrable
                  Securities; no holder shall be entitled to be named as a
                  selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement as
                  of the Effective Time, and no holder shall be entitled to use
                  the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of
                  Registrable Securities at any time, unless such holder has
                  returned a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to
                  the Issuers by the deadline for response set forth therein;
                  provided, however, holders of Registrable Securities shall
                  have at least 28 calendar days from the date on which the
                  Notice and Questionnaire is first mailed to such holders to

                  Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder,
                  promptly send a Notice and Questionnaire to such holder;
                  provided that the Issuers shall not be required to take any
                  action to name such holder as a selling securityholder in the
                  Shelf Registration Statement or to enable such holder to use
                  the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of
                  Registrable Securities until such holder has returned a
                  completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Issuers;

                  may be necessary to effect and maintain the effectiveness of
                  such Shelf Registration Statement for the period specified in
                  Section 2(b) and as may be required by the applicable rules

                  supplement or amendment simultaneously with or prior to its
                  being used or filed with the Commission;

                           (v) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
                  with respect to the disposition of all the Registrable
                  Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement in
                  accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
                  Electing Holders provided for in such Shelf Registration
                  Statement;

                  shall contain the substance of the amendment or waiver
                  proposed or effected, as the case may be;

                           (xix) in the event that any broker-dealer registered
                  under the Exchange Act shall underwrite any Registrable
                  Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting
                  syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution"
                  (within the meaning of the Conduct Rules (the "Conduct Rules")
                  of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
                  ("NASD") or any successor thereto, as amended from time to
                  time) thereof, whether as a holder of such Registrable
                  Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or
                  a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, assist
                  such broker-dealer in complying with the

                                       16
<PAGE>

                  requirements of such Conduct Rules, including, without
                  limitation, by (A) if such Conduct Rules shall so require,
                  engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in
                  such Conduct Rules) to participate in the preparation of the
                  Shelf Registration Statement relating to such Registrable
                  Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in
                  respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering
                  contemplated by such Shelf Registration Statement is an
                  underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales
                  agent, to recommend the yield of such Registrable Securities,
                  (B) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to
                  the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in
                  Section 6 hereof (or to such other customary extent as may be
                  requested by such underwriter), and (C) providing such
                  information to such broker-dealer as may be required in order
                  for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the
                  Conduct Rules; and

                           (xx) comply with all applicable rules and regulations
                  of the Commission, and make generally available to its
                  securityholders as soon as practicable but in any event not
                  later than eighteen months after the effective date of such
                  Shelf Registration Statement, an earning statement of the
                  Company and its subsidiaries complying with Section 11(a) of
                  the Securities Act (including, at the option of the Company,
                  Rule 158 thereunder).

                  (f) In the event that the Issuers would be required, pursuant
to Section 3(e)(viii)(F) hereof, to notify the Electing Holders, the placement
or sales agent, if any, therefor and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof,
the Issuers shall prepare and furnish to each of the Electing Holders, to each
placement or sales agent, if any, and to each such underwriter, if any, a
reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as
thereafter delivered to purchasers of Registrable Securities, such prospectus
conforms in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act, and shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances then existing. Each Electing Holder agrees that upon
receipt of any notice from the Issuers pursuant to Section 3(e)(viii)(F) hereof,
such Electing Holder shall forthwith discontinue the disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement applicable to such
Registrable Securities until such Electing Holder shall have received copies of
such amended or supplemented prospectus, and if so directed by the Issuers, such
Electing Holder shall deliver to the Issuers (at the Issuers' expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Electing Holder's
possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of
receipt of such notice.

                  (g) In the event of a Shelf Registration, in addition to the
information required to be provided by each Electing Holder in its Notice and
Questionnaire, the Issuers may require such Electing Holder to furnish to the
Issuers such additional information regarding such Electing Holder and such
Electing Holder's intended method of distribution of Registrable Securities as
may be required in order to comply with the Securities Act. Each such Electing
Holder agrees to notify the Issuers as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy
or change in information previously furnished by such Electing Holder to the
Issuers or of the occurrence of any event in either case as a result of which
any prospectus relating to such Shelf Registration contains or would contain an
untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such
Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities
or omits to state any material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such
Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities
required to be stated therein or necessary to

                                       17
<PAGE>

make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
existing, and promptly to furnish to the Issuers any additional information
required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required
so that such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to such Electing Holder
or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances then existing.

         4. Registration Expenses.

         The Issuers agree, subject to the last sentence of this Section 4, to

3(e)(xii) hereof and determination of their eligibility for investment under the

Notes), (d) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses relating to the offering,
sale or delivery of Notes and the preparation of documents referred in clause
(c) above, (e) fees and expenses of the Trustee under the Indenture, any agent
of the Trustee and any reasonable fees and expenses for counsel for the Trustee
and of any collateral agent or custodian, (f) internal expenses (including,
without limitation, all salaries and expenses of the Issuers' officers and
employees performing legal or accounting duties), (g) fees, disbursements and
expenses of counsel and independent certified public accountants of the Issuers

pursuant to Section 3(e)(xix) hereof, (i) reasonable fees, disbursements and

Shelf Registration, as selected by the Electing Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities held by Electing
Holders (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuers), (j) any
fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Notes, and (k)
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any other persons, including,
without limitation, special experts, retained by the Issuers in connection with
such registration (collectively, the "Registration Expenses"). To the extent
that any Registration Expenses are incurred, assumed or paid by any holder of
Registrable Securities or any placement or sales agent therefor or underwriter
thereof, the Issuers shall reimburse such person for the full amount of the
Registration Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid promptly after receipt of a
request therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of the Registrable
Securities being registered shall pay all agency fees and commissions and
underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of such
Registrable Securities

                                       18
<PAGE>

and the fees and disbursements of any counsel or other advisors or experts
retained by such holders (severally or jointly), other than the counsel and
experts specifically referred to above.

         5. Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

         Except with respect to clauses (a) and (b) below, the Issuers represent
and warrant to, and agree with, each Purchaser and each of the holders from time
to time of Registrable Securities the information set forth in this Section 5.

         With respect to clauses (a) and (b) below, the Issuers covenant that:

                  (a) Each registration statement covering Registrable
Securities and each prospectus (including, without limitation, any preliminary
or summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(e)
or Section 3(c) hereof and any further amendments or supplements to any such
registration statement or prospectus, when it becomes effective or is filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, and, in the case of an underwritten offering
of Registrable Securities, at the time of the closing under the underwriting
agreement relating thereto, will conform in all material respects to the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and at all times subsequent to the Effective Time when a prospectus
would be required to be delivered under the Securities Act, other than from (i)
such time as a notice has been given to holders of Registrable Securities
pursuant to Section 3(e)(viii)(F) or Section 3(c)(iii)(F) hereof until (ii) such
time as the Issuers furnishes an amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to
Section 3(f) or Section 3(c)(iv) hereof, each such registration statement, and
each prospectus (including, without limitation, any preliminary or summary
prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(e) or Section
3(c) hereof, as then amended or supplemented, will conform in all material
respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act
and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing;
provided, however, that this covenant shall not apply to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Issuers by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use
therein.

                  (b) Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus
referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are
or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed
in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this covenant shall
not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Issuers by a holder of Registrable
Securities expressly for use therein.

                  (c) The compliance by the Issuers with all the provisions of
this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a material
breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease, license, franchise
agreement, permit or other material agreement or instrument to which either of
the Issuers or any of Charter Communications, Inc. ("CCI"), Charter
Communications Holding

Company, LLC ("CCH LLC"), Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), CCH
I, LLC ("CCH I") and CCH II, LLC (collectively with CCI, CCH LLC, Holdings and
CCH I, the "Parent Companies") or the Issuers' subsidiaries is a party or by
which either of the Issuers or any of their Parent Companies or the Issuers'
subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Issuers
or any of their Parent Companies or the Issuers' subsidiaries is subject, nor
will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of
formation or limited liability company agreement of the Company or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of CCO Holdings Capital or any statute or
any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body,
including without limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the
Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, the Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, as amended, and the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (collectively, the "Cable Acts") or any order,
rule or regulation of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), having
jurisdiction over the Issuers or any of their Parent Companies or the Issuers'
subsidiaries or any of their properties, except for any such violation which
would not materially impair the Issuers' ability to comply herewith; and no
consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or
with any such court or governmental agency or body is required, including,
without limitation, under the Cable Acts or any order, rule or regulation of the
FCC, for the consummation by the Issuers of the transactions contemplated by
this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, except the registration under
the Securities Act of the Notes, qualification of the Indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
qualifications as may be required under State Notes or blue sky laws in
connection with the offering and distribution of the Notes.

                  (d) This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuers.

         6. Indemnification.

                  (a) The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and
hold harmless each holder of Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes, as the
case may be, covered by any Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf
Registration Statement (including each Purchaser and, with respect to any
prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 3(c)(ii) or (iv) hereof, each
holder (which may include any Purchaser) that is a broker-dealer and elects to
exchange for Exchange Notes any Registrable Securities that it acquired for its
own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities
(but not directly from the Issuers or any affiliate of the Issuers) for Exchange
Notes) (each an "Exchanging Dealer"), the affiliates, directors, officers,
employees and agents of each such holder and each person who controls any such
holder within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common
law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in
any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary prospectus or the prospectus
included in any registration statement, or in any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse
each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however,

                                       20
<PAGE>

that the Issuers will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made
therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Issuers by or on behalf of any such holder specifically for inclusion
therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the
Issuers may otherwise have.

                  The Issuers, jointly and severally, also agree to indemnify or
contribute as provided in Section 6(d) to Losses of any underwriter of
Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes, as the case may be, registered under a
Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees or agents and
each person who controls such underwriter within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, on substantially the same basis as that of
the indemnification of the Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this
Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any holder, enter into an underwriting
agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 3(e)(xvi) hereof.

                  (b) Each holder of Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes
covered by an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement (including each Purchaser and, with respect to any prospectus delivery
as contemplated in Section 3(c)(ii or iv) or Section 3(f) hereof, each
Exchanging Dealer) severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers
and each of their affiliates, directors, employees, members, managers and agents
and each Person who controls the Issuers within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing
indemnity from the Issuers to each such holder, but only with reference to
written information relating to such holder furnished to the Issuers by or on
behalf of such holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in
the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
liability which any such holder may otherwise have.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i)
will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and
to the extent such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the
indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any
event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified
party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b)
above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to
the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to
such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the
indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, except as
provided in the next sentence, after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
rights in the prior sentence, the indemnified party shall have the right to
employ its own counsel (and one local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall
bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the
use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified
party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or
potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall
have reasonably concluded that there may be

                                       21
<PAGE>

legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii)
the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party
shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense
of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, in connection with any
one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general circumstances or allegations, be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in
addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. An indemnifying
party shall not be liable under this Section 6 to any indemnified party
regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such
claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to
by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party agrees
to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including, without limitation, legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to
which such indemnifying party may be subject in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party
on the one hand and by the indemnified party on the other from the offering of
the Notes. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed
to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits
but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Benefits received by the Issuers shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of (x)
the total net proceeds from the initial placement of the Notes (before deducting
expenses) reflected in the Purchase Agreement and (y) the total amount of
Special Interest which the Issuers were not required to pay as a result of
registering the securities covered by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
or Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Benefits received
by the Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts
and commissions as reflected in the Purchase Agreement, and benefits received by
any other holders shall be deemed to be equal to the proceeds received from the
sale of the Registrable Securities or Exchange Notes, as applicable. Benefits
received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total
underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth in the prospectus forming a
part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement which resulted in such Losses. The relative fault shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the
one hand or the Indemnified party on the other and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata
allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses,

                                       22
<PAGE>

claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection (d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder
from the sale of Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and
commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such
holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price of the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the
public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. The holders' and any underwriters' obligations in
this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the principal
amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be,
by them, and not joint. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this
Section 6, each person who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the
meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director,
officer, employee and agent of a holder, agent or underwriter shall have the
same rights to contribution as such holder, agent or underwriter, and each
person who controls the Issuers within the meaning of either the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Issuers shall have the
same rights to contribution as the Issuers, subject in each case to the
applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

                  (e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force
and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any holder
or the Issuers or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred
to in this Section hereof, and will survive the sale by a holder of securities
covered by an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement.

         7. Underwritten Offerings.

                  (a) Selection of Underwriters. If any of the Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an
underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be
designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering,
provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are
reasonably acceptable to the Issuers.

                  (b) Participation by Holders. Each holder of Registrable
Securities hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may
participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees
to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve
such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

         8. Rule 144.

                                       23
<PAGE>

         Each of the Issuers covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities
that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, it
shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act
or the Securities Act (including, without limitation, the reports under Section
13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144
adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act), and shall take such further
action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable

provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the
