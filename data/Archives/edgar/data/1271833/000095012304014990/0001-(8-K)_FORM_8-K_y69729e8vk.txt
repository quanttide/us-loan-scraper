ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

On December 15, 2004, indirect subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc., CCO
Holdings, LLC (CCO Holdings) and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., (with CCO Holdings,
the Issuers) issued $550 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2010 (the
Notes). The Notes have a six-year term and have an annual interest rate of LIBOR
plus 4.125%, reset and payable quarterly.

The Issuers may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the Issuers' option from
December 15, 2006 until December 14, 2007 for 102% of the principal amount, from
December 15, 2007 until December 14, 2008 for 101% of the principal amount and
from and after December 15, 2008, at par, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest. At any time prior to December 15, 2006, the Issuers may redeem up to
35% of the Notes in an amount not to exceed the amount of proceeds of one or
more public equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus a premium equal to the interest rate per annum applicable
to the Notes on the date notice of redemption is given, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date, provided that at least 65% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued remains outstanding
after the redemption.

The Notes will be unsecured and will rank equally with all the existing and
future senior unsecured debt of the Issuers and senior to all existing and
future subordinated debt of the Issuers. The Notes will be effectively
subordinated to all of secured obligations of the Issuers to the extent of the
collateral securing those obligations and will be structurally subordinated to
indebtedness and other liability of the Issuers' subsidiaries.

The Issuers plan to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay down
debt of subsidiaries, which may include paying (but not reducing permanently)
revolving balances under Charter Communications Operating LLC's credit
facilities and paying amounts outstanding under their subsidiaries' outstanding
notes, and for general corporate purposes.

Under the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuers are restricted in their
ability to pay dividends on stock or repurchase stock; make investments; borrow
money; grant liens; sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with
or into other companies; use the proceeds from sales of assets and subsidiaries'
stock; in the case of restricted subsidiaries, create or permit to exist
dividend or payment restrictions; and engage in certain transactions with
affiliates.

Upon a change of control, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, the
Issuers may be required to offer to purchase all of the Notes at a purchase
price of 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of the purchase.

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers have agreed to file
with the SEC within ninety (90) days of the date of issuance a registration
statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange the notes for notes
with terms identical in all material respect to the Notes. In addition, the
Issuers have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the exchange offer
registration statement to become effective within 210 days after the date of
issuance; cause the exchange offer to be consummated within 30 business days
after the effective date of the exchange offer registration statement or longer,
if required by the federal securities laws; and file a shelf registration
statement for the resale of the Notes if the Issuers cannot effect an exchange
offer within the specified time period and in certain other circumstances. If
the Issuers fail to comply with certain obligations under the registration
rights agreements, the Issuers will be required to pay special interest to
holders of Notes.

The Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A
and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act), and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws.
